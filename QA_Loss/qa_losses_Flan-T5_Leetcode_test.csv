open question,"You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the garden.

Fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope, as it is expensive. The garden is well-fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed**.

Return _the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** trees = \[\[1,1\],\[2,2\],\[2,0\],\[2,4\],\[3,3\],\[4,2\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[2,0\],\[4,2\],\[3,3\],\[2,4\]\]
**Explanation:** All the trees will be on the perimeter of the fence except the tree at \[2, 2\], which will be inside the fence.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** trees = \[\[1,2\],\[2,2\],\[4,2\]\]
**Output:** \[\[4,2\],\[2,2\],\[1,2\]\]
**Explanation:** The fence forms a line that passes through all the trees.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= trees.length <= 3000`
*   `trees[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= xi, yi <= 100`
*   All the given positions are **unique**.","

    We use the **Graham's Scan Algorithm** to find the convex hull or the trees that form the fence perimeter. This algorithm works in O(n log n) time complexity.

1. First, we sort the trees based on their x coordinates. If two trees have the same x coordinate, they are sorted by their y coordinates.
2. We create an empty list called `hull` to store the trees that belong to the convex hull.
3. Iterate through the sorted `trees` and:
   a. For each tree `p`, we check if `hull` has at least two trees and the cross product of the last two trees and `p` is greater than 0.
   b. If the cross product is greater than 0, then the last tree in the `hull` doesn't belong to the convex hull, so we remove it.
   c. Add tree `p` to the `hull`.
4. Now we iterate through the sorted `trees` in reverse order and repeat steps 3a-3c.
5. At the end, the `hull` contains the coordinates of the trees that form the fence perimeter.

open question,"There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `ith` node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Remove two **distinct** edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

1.  Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for **each** of the three components respectively.
2.  The **difference** between the **largest** XOR value and the **smallest** XOR value is the **score** of the pair.

*   For example, say the three components have the node values: `[4,5,7]`, `[1,9]`, and `[3,3,3]`. The three XOR values are `4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = **6**`, `1 ^ 9 = **8**`, and `3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = **3**`. The largest XOR value is `8` and the smallest XOR value is `3`. The score is then `8 - 3 = 5`.

Return _the **minimum** score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,5,4,11\], edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\],\[3,4\]\]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes \[1,3,4\] with values \[5,4,11\]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node \[0\] with value \[1\]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node \[2\] with value \[5\]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,5,2,4,4,2\], edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[5,2\],\[4,3\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes \[3,4\] with values \[4,4\]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2nd component has nodes \[1,0\] with values \[5,5\]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3rd component has nodes \[2,5\] with values \[2,2\]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.

**Constraints:**

    1. Construct the tree using an adjacency list.
2. Calculate the XOR values for each subtree rooted at each node using a Depth First Search function. The DFS function will return the XOR value of the subtree rooted at a specific node by XOR'ing its value with the XOR values of its children subtrees.
3. Iterate over all distinct pairs of nodes, and calculate the three XOR values using the precomputed XOR values of these nodes.
   - xor1: the XOR value of the subtree rooted at the first node
   - xor2: the XOR value of the subtree rooted at the second node without the xor1 value. This can be computed as xor_values[second_node] ^ nums[first_node] (using the property that x ^ x = 0)
   - xor3: the XOR of the remaining nodes, which can be computed as nums[first_node] ^ nums[second_node] (since xor1 ^ xor2 ^ xor3 = 0)
4. Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest among xor1, xor2, and xor3, and update the minimum score if the difference is smaller than the current minimum.
5. Return the minimum score found.

open question,"Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the **category** of the box_.

*   The box is `""Bulky ""` if:
    *   **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to `104`.
    *   Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to `109`.
*   If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `""Heavy "".`
*   If the box is both `""Bulky ""` and `""Heavy ""`, then its category is `""Both ""`.
*   If the box is neither `""Bulky ""` nor `""Heavy ""`, then its category is `""Neither ""`.
*   If the box is `""Bulky ""` but not `""Heavy ""`, then its category is `""Bulky ""`.
*   If the box is `""Heavy ""` but not `""Bulky ""`, then its category is `""Heavy ""`.

**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300
**Output:**  ""Heavy ""
**Explanation:** 
None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104. 
Its volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as  ""Bulky "".
However mass >= 100, so the box is  ""Heavy "".
Since the box is not  ""Bulky "" but  ""Heavy "", we return  ""Heavy "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50
**Output:**  ""Neither ""
**Explanation:** 
None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.
Its volume = 8 \* 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as  ""Bulky "".
Its mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as  ""Heavy "" either. 
Since its neither of the two above categories, we return  ""Neither "".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= length, width, height <= 105`
*   `1 <= mass <= 103`","
    ```python
def boxCategory(length: int, width: int, height: int, mass: int) -> str:
    bulky = length >= 10000 or width >= 10000 or height >= 10000 or int(length) * width * height >= 1000000000
    heavy = mass >= 100
    
    if bulky and heavy:
        return ""Both ""
    if bulky:
        return ""Bulky ""
    if heavy:
        return ""Heavy ""
    return ""Neither ""
```
    
    The algorithm first checks if the box is bulky by verifying if any of the dimensions equal or exceed 10^4, or if the volume of the box is equal to or greater than 10^9. If the mass of the box is greater or equal to 100, then it's considered heavy.

We then use conditional statements to determine the category of the box according to the values of the bulky and heavy variables.

If both the bulky and heavy conditions are true, we return ""Both "". If bulky is true and heavy is false, we return ""Bulky "". If heavy is true and bulky is false, we return ""Heavy "". Otherwise, if neither condition is true, we return ""Neither "".

def insertIntoBST(root, val):

    else:
        root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val)

    return root
```
    
    The algorithm is a recursive algorithm that traverses the BST while looking for the correct position to insert the new value. From the root node, we compare the new value with the current node's value. If the new value is less than the current node's value, we move to the left child, and if the new value is greater, we move to the right child. We repeat this process until we reach a null child, in which case, we insert the new value as the child at that position. The base case is when the given root is null, in which case we simply return a new node with the value to insert. This guarantees that the resulting tree remains a valid BST after the insertion.

open question,"A **distinct string** is a string that is present only **once** in an array.

Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _**distinct string** present in_ `arr`. If there are **fewer** than `k` distinct strings, return _an **empty string**_ `"" ""`.

**Output:**  ""a ""
**Explanation:**
The only distinct strings in arr are  ""d "" and  ""a "".
 ""d "" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
 ""a "" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2,  ""a "" is returned.

    The algorithm uses condition variables (C++ and Java), locks (Python), or Promises (JavaScript). These are used to make sure that the three functions `zero`, `even`, and `odd` are called in the correct order. We maintain a counter `cnt` that is incremented after printing each number. The functions wait for the condition `cnt` to satisfy their respective conditions before they print the numbers and then they notify others to proceed. In the case of `zero`, it waits until `cnt` is odd and then prints 0, `even` waits until `cnt` equals 2 * current even number, and `odd` waits until `cnt` equals 2 * current odd number - 1. They repeat this process up to a length of 2n, producing the required series ""010203040506...""

open question,"There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [starti, endi, durationi]` indicates that the `ith` task should run for a total of `durationi` seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time range `[starti, endi]`.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.

Return _the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = \[\[2,3,1\],\[4,5,1\],\[1,5,2\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range \[2, 2\].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time range \[5, 5\].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges \[2, 2\] and \[5, 5\].
The computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = \[\[1,3,2\],\[2,5,3\],\[5,6,2\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range \[2, 3\].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time ranges \[2, 3\] and \[5, 5\].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time range \[5, 6\].
The computer will be on for a total of 4 seconds.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= tasks.length <= 2000`
*   `tasks[i].length == 3`
*   `1 <= starti, endi <= 2000`
*   `1 <= durationi <= endi - starti + 1`","

def min_time_on(tasks):
    intervals = sorted([[task[1] + 1, task[2]] for task in tasks])

    dp = [0] * 2001

        for i in range(2000, interval[0] - 1, -1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - interval[1]] + interval[1])

    return dp[-1]
```
    
    The algorithm first converts individual tasks into a more useful form: intervals with end time +1 and duration, which are then sorted based on the end time. This preprocessing step helps identify the tasks that can be scheduled earlier, and it ensures that the optimal scheduling for each task is found.

The dynamic programming approach maintains an array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the maximum duration of tasks which can be scheduled within the first `i` seconds.
For each interval `[end, duration]`, iterate through the `dp` array in reverse order from 2000 to `end`, and update each `dp[i]` value using the maximum between the current value of `dp[i]` and the value of `dp[i-duration]` plus the duration of the current task. The reverse order is necessary to iterate through the combinations of schedules to find the best sequence of tasks to fit within the given time slots.

At the end, the last element in the `dp` array represents the optimal schedule's total time, and thus the minimum time the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.

open question,"You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a **double booking**.

A **double booking** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

*   `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
*   `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **double booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MyCalendar "",  ""book "",  ""book "",  ""book ""\]
\[\[\], \[10, 20\], \[15, 25\], \[20, 30\]\]
**Output**
\[null, true, false, true\]

**Explanation**
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= start < end <= 109`
*   At most `1000` calls will be made to `book`.","
    ```python
from bisect import bisect_left, insort

class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = []

    def book(self, start, end):
        i = bisect_left(self.calendar, [start, end])
        if i % 2 == 1:
            return False
        if i > 0 and self.calendar[i-1] > start:
            return False
        if i < len(self.calendar) and end > self.calendar[i]:
            return False
        insort(self.calendar, start)
        insort(self.calendar, end)
        return True
```
    
    This algorithm uses a data structure (map in C++, TreeMap in Java, List in Python, and Map in JavaScript) to store the events in the calendar. The `book()` function takes in the start and end times of the event.

1. In C++, the function finds the iterator pointing to the position just greater than or equal to the start time. If there is an event before this iterator and its end time is greater than the start time of the new event, we return false as double booking occurs.
2. In Java, we use the floorKey and ceilingKey functions to find the events closest to the start time of the new event. We check if there is any overlap with these events, and if there is none, we insert the event into the calendar.
3. In Python, we use a bisect_left function to find the index at which the new event can be inserted. We then check if there is any overlap with the previous event or the next event in the list, and if not, we insert the start and end times of the new event in the calendar.
4. In JavaScript, the function iterates through the calendar's events and checks if there are any overlaps using the maximum of start times and the minimum of end times. If there are no overlaps, the new event is inserted into the calendar.

If there are no overlaps with other events (i.e., no double booking), the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j] * dp[j - 1]) % MOD
    return dp[numPeople // 2]
```

    
    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can use dp[i] to represent the number of different ways i pairs of people can perform handshakes without crossing. We initialize dp[0] to 1 as there is one way to perform no handshakes.

Now, we iterate from 1 to numPeople/2 inclusive. In each iteration, we consider one pair of people at a time. Suppose there are i pairs of people and the current pair to be considered is j. Then, the remaining pairs of people can be divided into two groups - one having j - 1 pairs and the other having i - j pairs. Thus, we can calculate dp[i] by using the previous values of dp[]. Specifically, dp[i] is updated as follows:
dp[i] = (dp[i] + (dp[i - j] * dp[j - 1]) % MOD) % MOD;

Finally, we return dp[numPeople / 2].

    To maximize the summation of the matrix's elements, we can follow these steps: 
1. Calculate the sum of the absolute values of all elements.
2. Count the number of negative elements in the matrix.
3. Determine the minimum absolute value of all elements in the matrix.
4. If the number of negative values is even, the sum remains the same.
5. If the number of negative values is odd, subtract twice the minimum absolute value from the sum, which accounts for turning an adjacent element from positive to negative, thereby increasing the overall sum.

In each language implementation, we create a function called `maxMatrixSum` that takes an n x n integer matrix as input and loops through the matrix to calculate the values described in the steps above. The function then returns either the sum of elements or the sum minus twice the minimum absolute value depending on the number of negative values. This way, we maximize the summation of the matrix's elements.

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

open question,"There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

*   On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
*   Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, **the same color cannot be used again**.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `targetGrid`, where `targetGrid[row][col]` is the color in the position `(row, col)` of the grid.

Return `true` _if it is possible to print the matrix_ `targetGrid`_,_ _otherwise, return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** targetGrid = \[\[1,1,1,1\],\[1,2,2,1\],\[1,2,2,1\],\[1,1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** targetGrid = \[\[1,1,1,1\],\[1,1,3,3\],\[1,1,3,4\],\[5,5,1,4\]\]
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** targetGrid = \[\[1,2,1\],\[2,1,2\],\[1,2,1\]\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** It is impossible to form targetGrid because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == targetGrid.length`
*   `n == targetGrid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 60`

```

    
    The algorithm keeps track of the bounding rectangles of each color and tries to print them in any order.

For each color, the bounding rectangle is calculated by searching for the minimum/maximum row/col coordinates of the same color.

To check if a rectangle can be printed, we examine each cell in the rectangle, making sure that either the cell is already covered by the current color or the cell is transparent and has not been covered by any other color. If a rectangle can be printed, we make it transparent (set its value in targetGrid to -1) and remove the color from the remaining colors set.

If a progress is made in the current iteration (removing at least one color), we continue with the next iteration. This loop will continue until there are no remaining colors or no further progress is made. If there are still remaining colors in the set when progress is not made anymore, it is impossible to print the target grid, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

The time complexity is O(N^4) since we iterate over all colors and 2D coordinates. The space complexity is O(N^2) because of the memory used in targetGrid and colorBounds.

    The problem requires us to find the good strings between s1 and s2 that do not contain the evil substring. We can accomplish this using dynamic programming and KMP prefix function.

First, we preprocess the KMP prefix function for the evil string. The KMP prefix function can be used to match overlapping substrings within the evil string, which will help us to detect the presence of the evil substring in our generated string candidates.

Next, we create a dp table, with dimensions `[n+1][m]`, where `n` is the length of s1 and s2, and `m` is the length of the evil string. We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1. The first dimension of the dp table keeps track of the current length of the generated string, while the second dimension keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of the evil string that matches the current suffix of the generated string.

Then, we iterate over the lengths of the string, and for each character in the current length, we check whether the character is a part of the evil substring. If it is not, we update the dp table accordingly. We also use the variable `k` to keep track of whether the generated substring is less than or equal to s2.

Finally, we return the result as `(dp[n][1] - dp[n][0] + MOD) % MOD`. This gives us the number of good strings without the evil substring, between s1 and s2.

Implement the **DataStream** class:

*   `DataStream(int value, int k)` Initializes the object with an empty integer stream and the two integers `value` and `k`.
*   `boolean consec(int num)` Adds `num` to the stream of integers. Returns `true` if the last `k` integers are equal to `value`, and `false` otherwise. If there are less than `k` integers, the condition does not hold true, so returns `false`.

\[null, false, false, true, false\]

**Explanation**
DataStream dataStream = new DataStream(4, 3); //value = 4, k = 3 
dataStream.consec(4); // Only 1 integer is parsed, so returns False. 
dataStream.consec(4); // Only 2 integers are parsed.

dataStream.consec(4); // The 3 integers parsed are all equal to value, so returns True.

    The algorithm uses the tortoise and hare algorithm (slow and fast pointers). The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. Since the fast pointer is moving twice as fast as the slow pointer, when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be in the middle. Thus, we can just return the slow pointer as the middle node. If there are two middle nodes, the slow pointer will be on the second middle node, as specified in the problem statement.

    The algorithm starts by initializing a map called `columns`, which will store the nodes by their column and row indexes. We also create a queue `q` to store the nodes with their row and column positions. The root is initially added to the queue with a position of `(0, 0)`.

We then loop through the nodes in the queue. For each node, we create a nested map in `columns` that maps column indexes to row indexes, and row indexes to a list (or multiset, or priority queue, depending on the language) of node values. We insert the current node's value into the list of its corresponding row and column indexes. If the current node has left or right children, we add them to the queue with their respective positions.

Finally, we build the vertical order traversal by iterating through the column index map `columns`. For each column, we create a new list and append the node values from each row in the column, in row order. This vertical list is then added to the final result.

The verticalTraversal function returns the result, which is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index in the binary tree.

2.  There is **at least** a gap of `2` rolls between **equal** valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the `ith` roll is **equal** to the value of the `jth` roll, then `abs(i - j) > 2`.

Return _the **total number** of distinct sequences possible_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.

Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
(1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).

2. Traverse the array `aliceArrows` from the last element (highest score) to the first element (lowest score).
3. If the current element of `aliceArrows` is 0 (Alice hasn't shot any arrows in the current section) and Bob still has arrows left, calculate the number of arrows Bob should shoot in this section as `min(numArrows, i+1)` (`i+1` is equal to the score of the current section).

open question,"Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. Each **unique** message should only be printed **at most every 10 seconds** (i.e. a message printed at timestamp `t` will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp `t + 10`).

All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

Implement the `Logger` class:

*   `Logger()` Initializes the `logger` object.
*   `bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message)` Returns `true` if the `message` should be printed in the given `timestamp`, otherwise returns `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input**

**Explanation**
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1,  ""foo "");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for  ""foo "" is 1 + 10 = 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,  ""bar "");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for  ""bar "" is 2 + 10 = 12

    The algorithm initializes an empty map to store message timestamps. The `shouldPrintMessage` function takes input parameters `timestamp` and `message`. It checks if the message is in the map or not. If the message is not in the map or the difference between the given timestamp and the message's timestamp is greater than or equal to 10, it updates the message's timestamp in the map with the given timestamp, and the function returns `true`. If the difference is less than 10, the function returns `false`. This ensures that messages will only be printed at most every 10 seconds.

open question,"There are `n` cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right and each car is present at a **unique** point.

You are given a **0-indexed** string `directions` of length `n`. `directions[i]` can be either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'S'` denoting whether the `ith` car is moving towards the **left**, towards the **right**, or **staying** at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the **same speed**.

The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:

*   When two cars moving in **opposite** directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by `2`.
*   When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by `1`.

After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.

Return _the **total number of collisions** that will happen on the road_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** directions =  ""RLRSLL ""
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
The collisions that will happen on the road are:
- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5.

    The algorithm for finding the k-radius averages consists of the following steps:
1. Initialize an array `avgs` of the same length as `nums`, and fill it with -1.
2. Loop through `nums`, starting at index `k` and ending at index `n - k - 1`.
   For each index `i`, do the following:
   a. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
   b. Loop through the subarray `nums[i - k]` to `nums[i + k]`, calculate the sum of its elements, and store it in `sum`.
   c. Calculate the average of the subarray by dividing `sum` by `2 * k + 1`, and store the result in `avgs[i]`.
3. Return the `avgs` array.

The algorithm provides integer division for each language as follows:
- C++ and Python: The division operator `//` performs integer division.
- Java: The division operator `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers.
- JavaScript: The `Math.floor` function is used to truncate the result of the division.

The complexity of this algorithm is O(n*k), as it iterates through each element in `nums` and sums its surrounding k elements.

    The algorithm iterates through all 32 bits of the given unsigned 32-bit integer, and for each bit, it shifts the result variable `res` one position to the left, and then performs a bitwise OR with the given number `n` ANDed with 1. This operation adds the least significant bit of `n` to the most significant bit of `res`. Then, the given number `n` is shifted one position to the right. The process is repeated for all 32 bits, and in each step, the result variable `res` accumulates the reversed bits of the input number.

open question,"You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`, where `location = [posx, posy]` and `points[i] = [xi, yi]` both denote **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You **cannot move** from your position, but you can **rotate**. In other words, `posx` and `posy` cannot be changed. Your field of view in **degrees** is represented by `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the **inclusive** range of angles `[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]`.

For each position, we try to move one of the two fingers and calculate the minimum distance between the previous position and the current position using the upper and lower bounds of the difference in X and Y coordinates. Then we add this distance to the result of a recursive call with the updated positions and skip the free positions (initial positions of the fingers). We perform these steps until we reach the end of the word. The base case is when we reach the end of the word, we return 0.

open question,"Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return _the root of the Quad-Tree representing_ `grid`.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

*   `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the `val` to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
*   `isLeaf`: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1.  If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
2.  If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
3.  Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format:**

You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.
 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\],\[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\],\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,1\],\[0,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,0\],null,null,null,null,\[1,0\],\[1,0\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]
**Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:

def construct(grid):
    return build(grid, 0, 0, len(grid))

    The algorithm first checks if the size of the grid is 1, in which case it returns a new Node with the value of the grid and sets the isLeaf attribute to True. Else, the algorithm calculates the half size of the matrix and recursively builds the topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, and bottomRight. If all of them are leaf nodes and their values are the same, the current node takes the value of topLeft and the isLeaf attribute is set to True; otherwise, it keeps building the quad-tree structure for each sub-grid.

The overall algorithm is recursive and implements a divide-and-conquer technique to build the quad-tree structure.

You are given a **0-indexed** `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where `grid[r][c]` represents the **height** of the building located in the block at row `r` and column `c`.

A city's **skyline** is the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The **skyline** from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.

We are allowed to increase the height of **any number of buildings by any amount** (the amount can be different per building). The height of a `0`\-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should **not** affect the city's **skyline** from any cardinal direction.

def custom_sort_string(order, s):
    return ''.join(sorted(s, key=lambda x: order.index(x) if x in order else len(order)))
```

    
    The key idea of this algorithm is to sort the characters in the string `s` based on the ordering specified by the string `order`. We can achieve this by passing a custom comparing function to the `sort` function for each language implementation used here. 

In C++, the custom comparator is provided as a lambda function that takes two characters, `a` and `b`, and compares their positions in the `order` string using `order.find(a) < order.find(b)`.

In Java, we follow a similar approach. First, we convert the string `s` to a Character array. Then, we provide the custom comparator as a lambda function `(a, b) -> order.indexOf(a) - order.indexOf(b)`. Finally, we concatenate the elements of the sorted array to form the result string.

In Python, we use the `sorted()` function with a custom lambda function for the `key` parameter: `order.index(x) if x in order else len(order)`. This ensures that if the character is not in `order`, it will be at the end of the sorted string.

In JavaScript, we first split the string `s` into an array of characters, then use the `sort()` function by providing a custom comparator as a lambda function `(a, b) => order.indexOf(a) - order.indexOf(b)`, and finally join the sorted array back into a string.

2. Initialize the first row and the first column of the 2D array by filling with their respective indices.
3. Iterate through the remaining elements of the 2D array, comparing the characters from str1 and str2. If they're equal, set dp[i][j] to 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]; otherwise, set dp[i][j] to 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

open question,"There are `n` hens and `m` grains on a line. You are given the initial positions of the hens and the grains in two integer arrays `hens` and `grains` of size `n` and `m` respectively.

Any hen can eat a grain if they are on the same position. The time taken for this is negligible. One hen can also eat multiple grains.

In `1` second, a hen can move right or left by `1` unit. The hens can move simultaneously and independently of each other.

Return _the **minimum** time to eat all grains if the hens act optimally._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** hens = \[3,6,7\], grains = \[2,4,7,9\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
One of the ways hens eat all grains in 2 seconds is described below:
- The first hen eats the grain at position 2 in 1 second. 
- The second hen eats the grain at position 4 in 2 seconds. 
- The third hen eats the grains at positions 7 and 9 in 2 seconds. 
So, the maximum time needed is 2.
It can be proven that the hens cannot eat all grains before 2 seconds.

**Input:** hens = \[4,6,109,111,213,215\], grains = \[5,110,214\]

- The fourth hen eats the grain at position 110 in 1 second.
- The sixth hen eats the grain at position 214 in 1 second. 
- The other hens do not move.

    The algorithm uses a binary search between the minimum time (0) and the maximum possible time (10^9) to determine the minimum time required for the hens to eat all the grains. We first sort both the hens and the grains arrays to make it convenient for comparison. Inside the while loop, we simulate if all the grains can be eaten within the given mid value (current time). If true, then we can reduce the time; else, we increase the time. We iterate through the grains and hens and increment the counter by checking if the ith hen can eat the current grain within the mid seconds. If not, we move to the next hen. If none of the hens can eat the grain within mid seconds or there are not enough hens left, then can_eat is set to false, which indicates that the current mid value is not enough.

Finally, we return the left value, which represents the minimum time required for hens to eat all the grains.

    The algorithm calculates the number of ways to color the m x n grid with no adjacent cells having the same color. If `m = 1`, we have a single column, and there are 2 ways to color one column (second cell differs from the first), and 3 ways to color two cells in a column (second cell differs from the first but matches the second row). If `m > 1`, there are two separate cases to consider when painting the third cell:

- Case 1: The third cell is not adjacent to any cells of the same color (it is safe). In this case, we have 3 options to paint the third cell, and the number of ways to paint the grid is multiplied by 3.
- Case 2: The third cell is adjacent to at least one cell of its color. In this case, we have 2 options to paint the third cell, and the number of ways is multiplied by 2.

We use dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways for each cell, starting from the initial values and updating the variables for cases 1 and 2 accordingly. Finally, we return the sum of ways depending on the value of `m`.

    The algorithm can be solved using Depth-First Search. To set up the environment, we first create an adjacency list called `graph` to represent the tree. We then perform the DFS from the first vertex, passing the parent, remaining time, target vertex, and graph as arguments.

Inside the helper function `dfs`, we have a base case when there are no more remaining seconds. In that case, we return 1.0 if the current node matches the target, otherwise, we return 0.0.

Next, we traverse the neighbors of the current node, skipping the parent node to avoid cycles. We perform DFS for each neighbor, subtracting one from the remaining time. As we recurse back, we accumulate the probability from each DFS call and divide it by the number of neighbors minus one (the parent). This correctly calculates the probability of reaching the target vertex after a certain period of time.

Finally, we return the probability from the DFS call.

    The algorithm is based on a recursive approach to build all possible full binary trees. Given an odd integer `n`, the tree will have `n` nodes. We perform a loop over all odd numbers smaller than `n`, considering each `i` as the number of nodes in the left subtree. The right subtree will have `n-i-1` nodes.

In each iteration, we recursively generate all possible full binary trees with `i` nodes for the left subtree and `n-i-1` nodes for the right subtree. We then combine all trees by pairing each left subtree with each right subtree and set the paired trees as children of a new root node `0`. The generated tree is a full binary tree with `n` nodes.

All resulting trees are appended to the result list. The recursion base case occurs when `n` is even (no possible full binary tree) or `n == 1` (the single node tree).

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * C(n)) when n is odd, where C(n) are the n-th catalan numbers, and O(1) when n is even. The space complexity is also O(n * C(n)) when n is odd, due to the generated trees.

open question,"Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ ""Hello "", ""World ""\]

**Explanation:**
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String\[\] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

        strs.append(s[delimiter_pos + 1:delimiter_pos + 1 + length])
        i = delimiter_pos + 1 + length
    return strs
```

    
    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

This algorithm works with any valid ASCII characters as it uses the length of the string in the encoding and decoding process.

In this variation, we calculate the probability of success for each edge/vertex and use it to update the maximum probabilities table, keeping the highest probability for each node. The algorithm begins with the start node and iterates through its neighbors, calculating new probabilities and updating the table if needed. If a node with an updated probability is found, we add it to the priority queue, keeping the highest probability nodes first. The process continues until the end node is reached or no more nodes can be visited. If the end node is reached, the algorithm returns its probability; otherwise, it returns 0.

    For all language implementations, the algorithm is to sort the input array while comparing each pair of elements with the pivot. If one of the elements is less than the pivot and the other is greater or equal, the ordering is preserved or reversed according to this relation.

In C++, `std::partition` is used on the input vector, which rearranges elements within the range based on the predicate provided (checking if the element is less than pivot). In Java and JavaScript, a custom comparator is provided for the `Arrays.sort()` and `Array.prototype.sort()` functions, respectively. In Python, we use the `sorted()` function with a custom key function that returns a tuple, making use of lexicographic ordering based on two values: whether the element is greater than or equal to the pivot, and the element itself. This approach effectively places elements less than the pivot first and maintains their order relative to each other.

You can use the `FontInfo` interface to get the width and height of any character at any available font size.

The `FontInfo` interface is defined as such:

interface FontInfo {
  // Returns the width of character ch on the screen using font size fontSize.
  // O(1) per call
  public int getWidth(int fontSize, char ch);

  // Returns the height of any character on the screen using font size fontSize.
  // O(1) per call

The calculated width of `text` for some `fontSize` is the **sum** of every `getWidth(fontSize, text[i])` call for each `0 <= i < text.length` (**0-indexed**). The calculated height of `text` for some `fontSize` is `getHeight(fontSize)`. Note that `text` is displayed on a **single line**.

It is guaranteed that `FontInfo` will return the same value if you call `getHeight` or `getWidth` with the same parameters.

It is also guaranteed that for any font size `fontSize` and any character `ch`:

*   `getHeight(fontSize) <= getHeight(fontSize+1)`
*   `getWidth(fontSize, ch) <= getWidth(fontSize+1, ch)`

    First, use a binary search to find the maximum valid font size in the `fonts` array since it is sorted in ascending order. The binary search is effective because we are searching for the maximum value of the fonts.

When we are at the mid position on each iteration, we check whether the current font size can fit the entire text in the screen. To do this, we calculate the width and height of the entire text using the font size.

If the current font size meets the width and height requirement, we update the left pointer and store the current font size as the answer. Otherwise, we move the right pointer to the left.

open question,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

*   An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
*   (An integer could be positive or negative.)
*   A let expression takes the form `""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr) ""`, where let is always the string `""let ""`, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression `expr`.
*   An add expression takes the form `""(add e1 e2) ""` where add is always the string `""add ""`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.
*   A mult expression takes the form `""(mult e1 e2) ""` where mult is always the string `""mult ""`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
*   For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names `""add ""`, `""let ""`, and `""mult ""` are protected and will never be used as variable names.
*   Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y)))) ""
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  ""(let x 3 x 2 x) ""
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** expression =  ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y)) ""
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= expression.length <= 2000`
*   There are no leading or trailing spaces in `expression`.
*   All tokens are separated by a single space in `expression`.
*   The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
*   The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.","

    First, we have the helper function `calculate`. It starts by checking if the expression starts with an opening parenthesis `(`. If so, it checks if it is an ""add"" or ""mult"" expression. If it's an ""add"" expression, it calculates the values of the two expressions inside it and returns their sum. If it's a ""mult"" expression, it calculates the values of the two expressions inside it and returns their multiplication.

If the expression starts with a ""let"" command, it creates a new `variables` Map (or dict/hashmap depending on the language) for the inner scope, which is a copy of the outer scope. It iterates through the string processing variable assignments sequentially, adding the variable and its value to the inner scope's `variables` Map. Once it reaches the final expression, it calls the `calculate` function again with this expression.

If the expression doesn't start with a parenthesis, it checks if it is a number or a variable. If it's a number, it returns the number parsed as an integer. If it's a variable, it returns the value of the variable from the `variables` Map.

The `evaluate` function is the entry point, which calls the `calculate` function with the entire expression string and an empty `variables` Map initially.

open question,"Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

*   If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
*   Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** chars = \[ ""a "", ""a "", ""b "", ""b "", ""c "", ""c "", ""c ""\]
**Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: \[ ""a "", ""2 "", ""b "", ""2 "", ""c "", ""3 ""\]
**Explanation:** The groups are  ""aa "",  ""bb "", and  ""ccc "". This compresses to  ""a2b2c3 "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** chars = \[ ""a ""\]
**Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: \[ ""a ""\]
**Explanation:** The only group is  ""a "", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** chars = \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b "", ""b ""\]
**Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""1 "", ""2 ""\].
**Explanation:** The groups are  ""a "" and  ""bbbbbbbbbbbb "". This compresses to  ""ab12 "".

*   `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
*   `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.","

def compress(chars):
    index, i = 0, 0
    
    while i < len(chars):
        count = 1
        while i + count < len(chars) and chars[i] == chars[i + count]:
            count += 1
            
        chars[index] = chars[i]

        i += count
        
    return index
```
    
    This algorithm iterates through the input array `chars`, for each character, it counts the number of consecutive occurrences (using `count` variable) of that character. Then, the algorithm replaces the current character(s) with the compressed form (the character itself, followed by the count if it is greater than 1). `index` keeps track of the position in the modified input array `chars`.

At the end of each iteration, the value of `i` is incremented by `count` to move to the next unique character in the array. Finally, the algorithm returns `index`, which is the new length of the array.

This implementation uses only constant extra space by modifying the input array itself and using a couple of simple variables.

open question,"You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of ""bulls "", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of ""cows "", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `""xAyB ""`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  ""1807 "", guess =  ""7810 ""
**Output:**  ""1A3B ""
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 ""1807 ""
  |
 ""7810 ""

**Input:** secret =  ""1123 "", guess =  ""0111 ""

 ""1123 ""         ""1123 ""
  |      or     |
 ""0111 ""         ""0111 ""
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

    The algorithm first initializes the counts for bulls and cows to be 0. We also create two arrays called secret_count and guess_count to store the count of each digit from '0' to '9' in the secret and guess strings.

We then loop through both the secret and the guess strings. For each position, if the digits are the same in both strings (i.e., secret[i] == guess[i]), we increase the bulls count. If not, we increment the corresponding count for the secret and guess digits.

After iterating through the strings, we loop through the count arrays and add the minimum of the counts of each digit in secret_count and guess_count to the cows count.

Finally, we return the result in the ""xAyB"" format by concatenating the values of bulls and cows.

Now, for each index, we take the difference of the calculated max values and the newly calculated expressions. After this step, we find the maximum of these 4 differences and update the result variable, which ultimately gives the required result after iterating through the entire index range.

The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

*   Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
    *   `R( ""a "") = { ""a ""}`
    *   `R( ""w "") = { ""w ""}`
*   When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
    *   `R( ""{a,b,c} "") = { ""a "", ""b "", ""c ""}`
    *   `R( ""{{a,b},{b,c}} "") = { ""a "", ""b "", ""c ""}` (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)
*   When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
    *   `R( ""{a,b}{c,d} "") = { ""ac "", ""ad "", ""bc "", ""bd ""}`
    *   `R( ""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h} "") = { ""abdfg "", ""abdfh "", ""abefg "", ""abefh "", ""acdfg "", ""acdfh "", ""acefg "", ""acefh ""}`

Formally, the three rules for our grammar:

*   For every lowercase letter `x`, we have `R(x) = {x}`.
*   For expressions `e1, e2, ... , ek` with `k >= 2`, we have `R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...`
*   For expressions `e1` and `e2`, we have `R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) * R(e2)}`, where `+` denotes concatenation, and `*` denotes the cartesian product.

Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return _the sorted list of words that the expression represents_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  ""{a,b}{c,{d,e}} ""
**Output:** \[ ""ac "", ""ad "", ""ae "", ""bc "", ""bd "", ""be ""\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  ""{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}} ""
**Output:** \[ ""a "", ""ab "", ""ac "", ""z ""\]
**Explanation:** Each distinct word is written only once in the final answer.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= expression.length <= 60`
*   `expression[i]` consists of `'{'`, `'}'`, `','`or lowercase English letters.

    The core of the algorithm is a parse function that takes an expression and current index. The parse function returns a set of possible strings based on the grammar. Initially, we call parse with the input expression and index 0. The parse function uses a loop that iterates through the expression characters. During each iteration:

1. If the current character is ""{"", we create a temporary set and generate all possible combinations of prefixes from the current set and postfixes from the inner parse call's result. We update the current set with this temporary set and update the index to the matching ""}"".

2. If the current character is ""}"", we break the loop as we reached the end of the recursion level.

3. If the current character is "","", we merge the current set into the result set and reset the current set to just contain an empty string.

4. Else, the character is a lowercase letter, so we create a new set by appending the character to each element of the current set and update the current set with this new set.

When the loop ends, we merge the current set into the result set one more time and return it. In the main function, we convert the final result set into a sorted list or array.

Notice that this algorithm respects the constraints given in the problem, and as such, it's guaranteed to work with the input expressions provided. The time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the expression length, and M is the maximum number of possible combinations that can be generated.

open question,"You are given an alphanumeric string `s`. (**Alphanumeric string** is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits).

You have to find a permutation of the string where no letter is followed by another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. That is, no two adjacent characters have the same type.

Return _the reformatted string_ or return **an empty string** if it is impossible to reformat the string.

    return ''.join(result)
```
    
    The algorithm first separates the input string `s` into two queues, `letters` and `digits`. This can be done by iterating through the input string `s` and checking if each character is a letter or digit. Then it checks if the difference between the number of letters and digits is greater than 1. If so, it returns an empty string as it is impossible to reformat the string with no two adjacent characters having the same type.

If the difference is not greater than 1, the algorithm initializes an empty result string or list. Then, it checks which type (letter or digit) has more elements, and iterates through the queues, alternating between types (letters and digits) and inserting the next character of the current type into the result. This ensures no two adjacent characters have the same type. Finally, the algorithm returns the result in the appropriate type (string or list, depending on the language).

The algorithm's complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

    The algorithm to solve this problem involves iterating through the given string and keeping track of counts for similar contiguous characters. Initialize a result variable, a count variable and the modulo for 10^9 + 7 to avoid large number problems.

Loop through the string starting from the second character. Compare the current character to the previous character. If the characters are the same, increment the count, otherwise reset it to 1. Add the count value to the result and perform modulo on the result after the addition.

After looping through the entire string, return the result. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

    We initialize two variables `min_prefix` and `prefix` both set to 0. We iterate over the elements in the `nums` array, adding each element to the `prefix`. At each iteration, we compare and store the minimum value between `min_prefix` and `prefix`.

The logic behind this algorithm is to find the minimum prefix sum that appears in the array. If this minimum prefix sum is negative, we need to perform operations to ""shift"" the array values so that the minimum prefix sum becomes non-negative. The minimum number of operations required to do this is equal to the absolute value of the minimum prefix sum found. If the minimum prefix sum is non-negative, there is no need to perform any operations.

Maintain an `indices` array of size `primes.length`, initialized with zeros. Each element `indices[j]` represents the index of the next super ugly number to multiply by `primes[j]`.

For each `i` from 1 to n, we calculate `ugly[i]` as the minimum of `ugly[indices[j]] * primes[j]` for all `j`. Then we increment the index `indices[j]` for which the condition `ugly[i] == ugly[indices[j]] * primes[j]` holds.

Finally, we return the last element of the `ugly` array, which is the nth super ugly number.

If a period is found, we replace it with ""[.]"" in the resulting string. For other characters, we just add them to the resulting string.

In C++, Java, and JavaScript, we iterate over each character using a for loop, appending the processed character to a string object or a StringBuilder object. Java uses a StringBuilder object for more efficient string concatenation.

open question,"Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, return `true` if there is a triplet `(i, j, k)` which satisfies the following conditions:

*   `0 < i, i + 1 < j, j + 1 < k < n - 1`
*   The sum of subarrays `(0, i - 1)`, `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(j + 1, k - 1)` and `(k + 1, n - 1)` is equal.

A subarray `(l, r)` represents a slice of the original array starting from the element indexed `l` to the element indexed `r`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
i = 1, j = 3, k = 5. 
sum(0, i - 1) = sum(0, 0) = 1
sum(i + 1, j - 1) = sum(2, 2) = 1
sum(j + 1, k - 1) = sum(4, 4) = 1
sum(k + 1, n - 1) = sum(6, 6) = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2\]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2000`
*   `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`","

def find_triplet_equal_sum(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]

    for i in range(1, n - 2):

                    return True
    return False
```
    
    The problem can be solved by calculating the prefix sum of the given `nums` array to optimize the sum calculation of subarrays. We use three nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. To check if the sum of the subarrays specified in the problem statement are equal, compare `s1`, `s2`, `s3` and `s4` which represent the sum of these subarrays, and return `true` if they are equal. If no triplet is found after iterating through all possible combinations, return `false`.

open question,"Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

**Example 1:**

To search for the index i such that prefixSum[i-1] < num <= prefixSum[i], C++ uses the `std::lower_bound` function, Python uses the `bisect_left` function, and Java and JavaScript use a while loop.

open question,"The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7

    return abs(dp[0][0]) + 1
```
    
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the minimum health needed in a bottom-up manner by starting from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon to the top-left corner. We create a ""dp"" table with the same size as the dungeon and fill it initially with zeros. Then we iterate over each cell in the dungeon from the bottom-right to the top-left. For each cell, we consider the right and down adjacent cells (if they exist) and calculate the minimum health required to move forward. We update the ""dp"" table with these values. The minimum of the health required to move right or down, plus the current cell dungeon value, is then stored in the current cell in the ""dp"" table. Finally, we return the absolute value of the top-left cell of ""dp"" table plus one (for the initial health point). This gives us the minimum initial health needed to get to the princess.

    The algorithm first calculates the hash of the first `k` characters of the string `s`. It also computes `power^K % modulo`. Then it iterates through the rest of the string and tries to find a substring with the target hash value by using a sliding window of size `k`.

For each iteration, the hash of the current substring is adjusted by removing the contribution of the first character on the previous substring and adding the contribution of the new character. This approach prevents recomputation and maintains a running hash of the current substring.

Once a substring with the target hash value is found, it is returned. If no valid substring is found, an error is raised (in some languages, an exception is thrown).

Then, we iterate through the first half of the nums and use the two-pointer technique to find pairs of elements that minimize the maximum pair sum. For each pair, we calculate the sum of the current element and the element at the opposite end of the array (last element minus the index). We then update max_sum with the max value between the current max_sum and the pair sum for each iteration. Finally, we return the max_sum.

open question,"A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return _an array of length 2 containing_ `[minDistance, maxDistance]` _where_ `minDistance` _is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and_ `maxDistance` _is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return_ `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,1\]
**Output:** \[-1,-1\]
**Explanation:** There are no critical points in \[3,1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[5,3,1,2,5,1,2\]
**Output:** \[1,3\]
**Explanation:** There are three critical points:
- \[5,3,**1**,2,5,1,2\]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- \[5,3,1,2,**5**,1,2\]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- \[5,3,1,2,5,**1**,2\]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7\]
**Output:** \[3,3\]
**Explanation:** There are two critical points:
- \[1,**3**,2,2,3,2,2,2,7\]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- \[1,3,2,2,**3**,2,2,2,7\]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

open question,"There is a knight on an `n x n` chessboard. In a valid configuration, the knight starts **at the top-left cell** of the board and visits every cell on the board **exactly once**.

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` consisting of distinct integers from the range `[0, n * n - 1]` where `grid[row][col]` indicates that the cell `(row, col)` is the `grid[row][col]th` cell that the knight visited. The moves are **0-indexed**.

Return `true` _if_ `grid` _represents a valid configuration of the knight's movements or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Note** that a valid knight move consists of moving two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The figure below illustrates all the possible eight moves of a knight from some cell.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,11,16,5,20\],\[17,4,19,10,15\],\[12,1,8,21,6\],\[3,18,23,14,9\],\[24,13,2,7,22\]\]

**Explanation:** The above diagram represents the grid. It can be shown that it is a valid configuration.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,3,6\],\[5,8,1\],\[2,7,4\]\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The above diagram represents the grid. The 8th move of the knight is not valid considering its position after the 7th move.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= n <= 7`
*   `0 <= grid[row][col] < n * n`
*   All integers in `grid` are **unique**.","

                return False
    return True
```
    
    The problem can be solved by simulating the possible moves of the knight from each cell. We start by traversing the given `grid`. For each cell `(i, j)` with value `k`, we check whether the knight's next move would be valid or not. The next move of the knight can be one of the following four moves, given the knight is at `(i, j)`:
- Move to `(i+1, j+2)` if it is within the grid boundaries, and it's the next expected cell (`k+1`).
- Move to `(i+1, j-2)` if it is within the grid boundaries, and it's the next expected cell (`k+1`).
- Move to `(i+2, j+1)` if it is within the grid boundaries, and it's the next expected cell (`k+1`).
- Move to `(i+2, j-1)` if it is within the grid boundaries, and it's the next expected cell (`k+1`).

The function `isValidMove(i, j, k, n)` checks whether the knight can move to cell with value `k` or not. During the grid traversal, if we find a cell for which the next move is not valid, we return `false`. If we successfully traverse the entire grid, it means the configuration is valid, and we return `true`.

open question,"There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = \[\[10,16\],\[2,8\],\[1,6\],\[7,12\]\]

**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons \[2,8\] and \[1,6\].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons \[10,16\] and \[7,12\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = \[\[1,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,6\],\[7,8\]\]
**Output:** 4

    The algorithm sorts the given points by the end value of their ranges. Then, it initializes a variable `arrows` to 1 (to count the first arrow) and `end` to the end value of the first point (to keep track of the last point reached by arrows).

Then, it iterates through the array, starting from the second point to the end. For each point, it checks whether the start value is greater than the current `end` value. If it is, that means this point is not covered by the previous arrows, so it increments the `arrows` counter and updates `end` to the end value of the current point.

Finally, it returns the value of `arrows` as the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.

2. Iterate through the characters in the input string `s`.
3. If the current character is 'a', increment the `aCount` counter.
4. If the current character is 'b', check if the `aCount` counter is greater than 0.

7. At the end of the loop, return the `deletions` counter as the result.

This algorithm ensures that for each 'b' character we encounter, we either pair it with a previously seen 'a' character or delete it if there are no 'a's to pair with. As a result, we minimize the number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.

    The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the factorials and inverse factorials for numbers up to the length of the given string, using modulo arithmetic.
2. For each character in the string, count the number of characters to the right that are less than the current character.
3. Multiply that count by the factorial of the number of remaining characters to the right, modulo the large prime number, and add it to the result.

In this way, the algorithm takes into account all possible permutations generated through the process of sorting, accumulating the required operations to make the string sorted.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n` that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:

*   `0` represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
*   `1` represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
*   All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes `1` step to travel between adjacent grid cells.

You are also given integer arrays `pricing` and `start` where `pricing = [low, high]` and `start = [row, col]` indicates that you start at the position `(row, col)` and are interested only in items with a price in the range of `[low, high]` (**inclusive**). You are further given an integer `k`.

You are interested in the **positions** of the `k` **highest-ranked** items whose prices are **within** the given price range. The rank is determined by the **first** of these criteria that is different:

1.  Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the `start` (**shorter** distance has a higher rank).
2.  Price (**lower** price has a higher rank, but it must be **in the price range**).
3.  The row number (**smaller** row number has a higher rank).
4.  The column number (**smaller** column number has a higher rank).

Return _the_ `k` _highest-ranked items within the price range **sorted** by their rank (highest to lowest)_. If there are fewer than `k` reachable items within the price range, return _**all** of them_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,2,0,1\],\[1,3,0,1\],\[0,2,5,1\]\], pricing = \[2,5\], start = \[0,0\], k = 3
**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]
**Explanation:** You start at (0,0).
With a price range of \[2,5\], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1
- (1,1) with distance 2
- (2,1) with distance 3
- (2,2) with distance 4
Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,2,0,1\],\[1,3,3,1\],\[0,2,5,1\]\], pricing = \[2,3\], start = \[2,3\], k = 2
**Output:** \[\[2,1\],\[1,2\]\]
**Explanation:** You start at (2,3).
With a price range of \[2,3\], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,1\],\[2,3,4\]\], pricing = \[2,3\], start = \[0,0\], k = 3
**Output:** \[\[2,1\],\[2,0\]\]
**Explanation:** You start at (0,0).
With a price range of \[2,3\], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). 
The ranks of these items are: 
- (2,1) with distance 5

    The algorithm checks all the positions of the board to find one that matches the first character of the given `word`. When it finds a match, it calls the `checkWord` function (passing the current position and direction) to check if the `word` can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If it can, it immediately returns `true`, otherwise it continues searching. If it fails to find a valid position, it returns `false`. 

The `checkWord` function checks if the `word` can be placed in the board based on the given position and direction. It iterates over the characters of the `word`, verifying if its current position in the board is valid:
- If the character is at the first or last position of the `word`, it checks if the current cell in the board is the same as the character or is empty.
- If the character is in the middle of the `word`, it checks if the current cell in the board is the same as the character or empty, but not blocked (`#`).
- If the position is not valid, it immediately returns `false`.

If all positions are valid, the function returns `true`.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid integers with no consecutive 1s in their binary representation. It initializes an array `dp` with the dimensions [32][2], where the first dimension represents the length of the binary representation and the second dimension represents whether the last bit is a 1 (consecutive 1s) or a 0.

For every index i from `1` to `32`, dp[i][0] represents the count of valid integers without leading 1s, while dp[i][1] represents the count of valid integers without consecutive 1s ending with a 1. Starting from the highest bit and moving to the lowest bit, the algorithm checks if bit `i` is set in the given number `n`. If the bit is set, the algorithm increments the counter `ans` by the number of valid integers with that bit position.

If the previous bit was set, the algorithm breaks the loop because consecutive 1s were found. Finally, the algorithm returns the count of valid integers incremented by 1 to account for the integer 0, which always satisfies the condition.

    1. For each language, the function accepts the input array `digits`.
2. We sort the input array in non-decreasing order.
3. We use a helper function to perform recursion and create permutations. The helper function takes parameters for the digits, the current permutation being formed, the set of unique permutations, and a tracking array called `used` to keep track of digits that have been used in the current permutation.
4. In the helper function, if the length of the current permutation matches the length of the input array, we have a complete permutation, so we convert the current permutation into an integer and insert it into the result set.
5. If the current permutation is not complete, we iterate through the input array, and for each digit that is not already used in the current permutation, we mark it as used, add it to the current permutation, and call the helper function recursively.
6. After a recursive call, we remove the last added digit from the current permutation and mark that digit as unused.

        same = temp

```
    
    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

    return result
```
    
    The algorithm uses a hash map to store counts of prefix sums. The prefix sum is incremented by `num - 1` for each element in the input array. Then, the algorithm checks if `(prefix_sum - k)` exists as a key in the hash map.

If it exists, the value of the hash map at that key is added to the result, because it represents the number of good subarrays ending at that element. After this, the hash map is updated with the current prefix sum count.

This process is repeated for every element in the array, and the final result is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

open question,"We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence `""I am happy with leetcode ""` can be represented as `arr = [ ""I "", ""am "",happy "", ""with "", ""leetcode ""]`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs `similarPairs` where `similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates that the two words `xi` and `yi` are similar.

Return `true` _if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar, or_ `false` _if they are not similar_.

Two sentences are similar if:

*   They have **the same length** (i.e., the same number of words)
*   `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar, and the words `b` and `c` are similar, then `a` and `c` are **similar**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""great "", ""acting "", ""skills ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""fine "", ""drama "", ""talent ""\], similarPairs = \[\[ ""great "", ""good ""\],\[ ""fine "", ""good ""\],\[ ""drama "", ""acting ""\],\[ ""skills "", ""talent ""\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""I "", ""love "", ""leetcode ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""I "", ""love "", ""onepiece ""\], similarPairs = \[\[ ""manga "", ""onepiece ""\],\[ ""platform "", ""anime ""\],\[ ""leetcode "", ""platform ""\],\[ ""anime "", ""manga ""\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ""leetcode "" -->  ""platform "" -->  ""anime "" -->  ""manga "" -->  ""onepiece "".
Since  ""leetcode is similar to  ""onepiece "" and the first two words are the same, the two sentences are similar.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""I "", ""love "", ""leetcode ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""I "", ""love "", ""onepiece ""\], similarPairs = \[\[ ""manga "", ""hunterXhunter ""\],\[ ""platform "", ""anime ""\],\[ ""leetcode "", ""platform ""\],\[ ""anime "", ""manga ""\]\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  ""leetcode "" is not similar to  ""onepiece "".

    We start by checking if sentence1 and sentence2 have the same length, otherwise, they cannot be similar. Then, create a graph using an adjacency list to represent the similarity pairs. Iterate through sentence1 and sentence2 in parallel, compare each pair of words exactly in the same position in both sentences. If a pair of words is equal, they are already similar, so we continue with the next pair. If not, we look for the word from sentence2 in the adjacency list for the word from sentence1. If we find it, they are similar; if not, the sentences are not similar. If all pairs are marked as similar, we return `True`, otherwise `False`.

open question,"Given a string s, return _the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `a1, a2, ...` and `b1, b2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `ai != bi`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""bccb ""
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba ""
**Output:** 104860361
**Explanation:** There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 109 + 7.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s[i]` is either `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`.","

            dp[c][j] = (dp[c][j] + MOD) % MOD

    return sum(dp[c][n] for c in range(4)) % MOD
```

    
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming. The state of `dp[i][j]` stores the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences of `s` with characters from index `i` to `j - 1`, and only considering the character `s[i]`. Iterating over the string from the back, the algorithm checks the current character into its corresponding bucket, and updates the current bucket's values based on the previous state.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(N), as the algorithm only stores palindromic subsequences for each character from 'a' to 'd'.

            max_len = i + 1
    return max_len
```

    
    The algorithm uses two hash maps: `count` to store the occurrence count (frequency) of each number in nums, and `freq` to store the count of numbers having the same frequency. For each element in nums, the algorithm updates both count and freq maps, and keeps track of the maximum frequency found so far. The algorithm calculates the max_len by checking two conditions:
1. If the product of max_freq and (i + 1) equals i, which means that after removing one element, all elements have the same frequency.
2. If the product of max_freq and (number of elements having the frequency max_freq - 1 plus 1) plus the product of (max_freq - 1) and (number of elements having the frequency max_freq - 1) equal i. This condition means that after removing one element, all elements have either the same frequency or a difference of 1 in their frequencies.
If either of the two conditions is met, the current index + 1 is considered as the maximum length of a valid prefix. The algorithm iterates through nums to find the answer.

    The algorithm used is a dynamic programming approach, where we maintain a 3D DP array `dp` with dimensions m x n x 2. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we store the maximum non-negative product and the minimum non-positive product of the path up until cell (i, j) in the grid. We initialize the first row and first column of the grid, and then iterate through the remaining cells.

At each cell, if the corresponding grid value is negative, the product of this value with the minimum non-positive value of the previous cells will give the maximum non-negative value for the current cell, and vice versa for minimum non-positive value. If the value is non-negative, multiplying by maximum non-negative values from previous cells will give the maximum non-negative value for the current cell, and similarly for minimum non-positive value.

After filling out the DP array, the result is the modulo of the maximum non-negative product of the last cell in the DP array, unless it's negative, in which case we return -1.

In each iteration, we look for the middle value `mid`. For each row `i`, we count the number of elements that are less than or equal to `mid`. The count is the sum of either `mid // i` or `n`, whichever is smaller. Then we check if the count is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, we move `low` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, we move `high` to `mid`. Once the search space narrowed down to a single value, we return that value as the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

    The algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) for visiting nodes sorted by the number of steps first and the price of the item second. In each iteration, we pop the element with the highest priority (meaning the lowest number of steps to reach and highest price) and process the reachable nodes. If the popped element's price is within the given price range, we add the position to the result list, and decrease k. We continue this process until there are no more elements in the priority queue or k reaches 0.

We use a visited matrix to track visited cells and avoid visiting them again.

open question,"Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`, return _the **maximum** integer you can paint under the following rules_:

*   The cost of painting a digit `(i + 1)` is given by `cost[i]` (**0-indexed**).
*   The total cost used must be equal to `target`.
*   The integer does not have `0` digits.

Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return `""0 ""`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5\], target = 9
**Output:**  ""7772 ""
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost( ""7772 "") = 2\*3+ 3\*1 = 9. You could also paint  ""977 "", but  ""7772 "" is the largest number.
**Digit    cost**
  1  ->   4
  2  ->   3
  3  ->   2
  4  ->   5
  5  ->   6
  6  ->   7
  7  ->   2
  8  ->   5
  9  ->   5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8\], target = 12
**Output:**  ""85 ""
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost( ""85 "") = 7 + 5 = 12.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4\], target = 5
**Output:**  ""0 ""
**Explanation:** It is impossible to paint any integer with total cost equal to target.

**Constraints:**

*   `cost.length == 9`
*   `1 <= cost[i], target <= 5000`","
    ```python
def largestNumber(cost, target):
    dp = ["""" for _ in range(target + 1)]

        for j in range(cost[i], target + 1):
            if dp[j - cost[i]] != None and len(dp[j - cost[i]]) < j - cost[i] \

                dp[j] = dp[j - cost[i]] + str(i + 1)

    return dp[target] if dp[target] else ""0""
```
    
    To solve this problem, we use a dynamic programming approach. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` keeps the maximum integer using the total cost `i`. To find the value of `dp[i]`, we keep track of the maximum integer up to the cost `i - cost[j]` for each of the paint costs and add the digit `j + 1`. Then, we compare the lengths of the integers at `dp[i - cost[j]]` and `dp[i]` to determine which one generates the maximum integer. At the end, we return `dp[target]`. If there is no solution, the default value will be an empty string which is changed to ""0"" before returning.

open question,"**Run-length encoding** is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array `nums` with many segments of **consecutive repeated** numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array `encoded`. Each `encoded[i] = [vali, freqi]` describes the `ith` segment of repeated numbers in `nums` where `vali` is the value that is repeated `freqi` times.

*   For example, `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]` is represented by the **run-length encoded** array `encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]`. Another way to read this is ""three `1`'s followed by five `2`'s "".

The **product** of two run-length encoded arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` can be calculated using the following steps:

1.  **Expand** both `encoded1` and `encoded2` into the full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
2.  Create a new array `prodNums` of length `nums1.length` and set `prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i]`.
3.  **Compress** `prodNums` into a run-length encoded array and return it.

You are given two **run-length encoded** arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` representing full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Both `nums1` and `nums2` have the **same length**. Each `encoded1[i] = [vali, freqi]` describes the `ith` segment of `nums1`, and each `encoded2[j] = [valj, freqj]` describes the `jth` segment of `nums2`.

Return _the **product** of_ `encoded1` _and_ `encoded2`.

**Note:** Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the **minimum** possible length.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** encoded1 = \[\[1,3\],\[2,3\]\], encoded2 = \[\[6,3\],\[3,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[6,6\]\]
**Explanation:** encoded1 expands to \[1,1,1,2,2,2\] and encoded2 expands to \[6,6,6,3,3,3\].
prodNums = \[6,6,6,6,6,6\], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array \[\[6,6\]\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** encoded1 = \[\[1,3\],\[2,1\],\[3,2\]\], encoded2 = \[\[2,3\],\[3,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,3\],\[6,1\],\[9,2\]\]
**Explanation:** encoded1 expands to \[1,1,1,2,3,3\] and encoded2 expands to \[2,2,2,3,3,3\].
prodNums = \[2,2,2,6,9,9\], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array \[\[2,3\],\[6,1\],\[9,2\]\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= encoded1.length, encoded2.length <= 105`
*   `encoded1[i].length == 2`
*   `encoded2[j].length == 2`
*   `1 <= vali, freqi <= 104` for each `encoded1[i]`.
*   `1 <= valj, freqj <= 104` for each `encoded2[j]`.
*   The full arrays that `encoded1` and `encoded2` represent are the same length.","

        product = encoded1[i][0] * encoded2[j][0]
        count = min(encoded1[i][1] - count1, encoded2[j][1] - count2)
        count1 += count

        if count2 == encoded2[j][1]:
            j += 1
            count2 = 0

    return result
```
    
    The algorithm simply iterate through both `encoded1` and `encoded2` arrays, calculating the products at every segment, compressing it into a formatted run-length encoded array in the form of [val, freq], and appending the compressed parts to the `result` list. I utilize two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through `encoded1` and `encoded2` respectively, and two additional counters `count1` and `count2` to keep track of the elements consumed in the respective arrays. At every iteration, I calculate the minimum count of consecutive elements to consume and update the result.

This way, the algorithm does not need to expand the entire `encoded1` and `encoded2` arrays, thus improving the time complexity from O(n) to O(len(encoded1) + len(encoded2)). Each segment is calculated and compressed on-the-fly, and stored in `result`. Finally, after both arrays are consumed, just return the `result`.

    return dp[m][n]
```
    
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve the problem. It first initializes a 2D DP array `dp` with dimensions `m+1` by `n+1` where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. The DP entry `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of steps required to make the prefixes `word1[0...i-1]` and `word2[0...j-1]` equal. 

The algorithm then populates the DP table using the following rules:
1. If either `i` or `j` is 0, then `dp[i][j] = i + j` since it needs to delete all characters from the other string.
2. If `word1[i-1]` is the same as `word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
3. Else, `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`, as we can either remove `word1[i-1]` or `word2[j-1]`.

Finally, the algorithm returns the value `dp[m][n]` as it represents the minimum number of steps required to make the two input strings equal.

    The algorithm uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (also known as the Knuth shuffle) to achieve a uniformly random shuffle of the input array. It starts from the last element of the array and iterates to the first element. For each element, it chooses a random index (j) from 0 to i (inclusive), and then swaps the element at index i with the element at index j. This ensures that all elements will be shuffled uniformly.

This solution makes use of classes and methods in each language. The constructor initializes the original array which holds the input array. The reset() method simply returns the original array. The shuffle() method performs the Fisher-Yates shuffle and returns the shuffled array. Note that in each shuffle() method, we create a copy of the original array and operate on that copy to avoid modifying the original array.

    The circular queue is implemented using an array with fixed capacity. The operations are performed based on FIFO principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. We keep a head and tail pointer, as well as the current size of the queue. Whenever an element is enqueued, we move the tail pointer forward (circulating back to the start of the array when necessary) and increase the size. When an element is dequeued, we move the head pointer forward and decrease the size. We can check if the queue is empty by comparing the size to 0 and check if the queue is full by comparing the size to the capacity. All operations have O(1) time complexity.

    1. When initializing the object, create a 2D table `dp` to store partial sums of the 2D array `matrix`. The dimensions of `dp` is one unit larger than the dimensions of `matrix`.
2. For each element (i, j) in `matrix`, add its value to the partial sums `dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]`, subtract the overlapping sum `dp[i][j]`, and store the result at `dp[i+1][j+1]`.
3. When updating the value of a cell, calculate the difference between the new and old values, and propagate it through the remaining cells in the corresponding row and column in the `dp` table.
4. To calculate the sum within a given rectangle, use the values stored in the `dp` table as follows:
  - Add the value of the lower-right corner: `dp[row2+1][col2+1]`
  - Subtract the values of the upper-right and lower-left corners: `dp[row2+1][col1]` and `dp[row1][col2+1]`
  - Add back the value of the upper-left corner: `dp[row1][col1]`

open question,"You are given a string `num`, which represents a large integer. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `change` of length `10` that maps each digit `0-9` to another digit. More formally, digit `d` maps to digit `change[d]`.

You may **choose** to **mutate a single substring** of `num`. To mutate a substring, replace each digit `num[i]` with the digit it maps to in `change` (i.e. replace `num[i]` with `change[num[i]]`).

Return _a string representing the **largest** possible integer after **mutating** (or choosing not to) a **single substring** of_ `num`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num =  ""132 "", change = \[9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8\]
**Output:**  ""832 ""
**Explanation:** Replace the substring  ""1 "":
- 1 maps to change\[1\] = 8.
Thus,  ""132 "" becomes  ""832 "".
 ""832 "" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  ""021 "", change = \[9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6\]
**Output:**  ""934 ""
**Explanation:** Replace the substring  ""021 "":
- 0 maps to change\[0\] = 9.
- 2 maps to change\[2\] = 3.
- 1 maps to change\[1\] = 4.
Thus,  ""021 "" becomes  ""934 "".

open question,"Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbcbcac ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  ""aa "" +  ""bc "" +  ""c "", and s2 into s2 =  ""dbbc "" +  ""a "".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  ""aa "" +  ""dbbc "" +  ""bc "" +  ""a "" +  ""c "" =  ""aadbbcbcac "".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbbaccc ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Input:** s1 =  "" "", s2 =  "" "", s3 =  "" ""
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

    dp[0][0] = True

```
    
    We use a dynamic programming approach (2D DP) to solve this problem. The algorithm checks whether the s3[position] is equal to s1 or s2 in the same dp[position]. If so, we take the value of the previous dp[i-1] or dp[j-1] accordingly if the characters match. For the base case, we start with initializing dp[0][0] to true since two empty strings can form an empty s3.

At the end of the iterations, the last element in the dp matrix (i.e. dp[m][n]) will represent whether s3 can be formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

        return False
    return (node1.val == node2.val) and checkSymmetry(node1.right, node2.left) and checkSymmetry(node1.left, node2.right)
```
    
    The algorithm works by comparing the left subtree and right subtree of the root node. It uses a helper function, 'checkSymmetry()', which takes two nodes as its arguments. The base cases for this helper function are when both nodes are null, in which case the function should return true, or when one of the nodes is null, in which case the function should return false.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

open question,"The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

Given an array `nums`, return _the **maximum alternating sum** of any subsequence of_ `nums` _(after **reindexing** the elements of the subsequence)_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

**Example 1:**

    The solution calculates the sum of the given array and finds the difference between the goal and the sum (abs(goal - sum)). Then, it calculates the required number of elements to add based on the limit. To find the minimum number of elements, we divide the difference by the limit and round up to the closest integer value.

- If the character is one of 'r', 'o', 'a', or 'k', it checks if the previous letter in ""croak"" has a non-zero count in the `counts` array. If it does, it transfers the count of the previous letter to the count of the current character; otherwise, it returns -1, as the string does not represent a valid croak sequence.

    The algorithm does a post-order traversal of the tree and calculates the sums of the subtrees as it traverses. It stores these sums in a set (or unordered_set in C++). Then, it checks if the set contains a value equal to half the total sum of the tree. If it does, that means there is a subtree with equal sum to the other half of the tree after removing one edge (which connects the subtree to the main tree). If the total sum is odd, it is not possible to divide the tree into two equal parts and it returns false.

    The AuthenticationManager class uses a hash map to store the tokens, with tokens represented by keys and their expiration times by values. It is initialized with a timeToLive value.

The generate method creates a new token and its expiration time by adding the timeToLive value to the current time, stored as a key-value pair in the hash map.

The renew method first checks if the tokenId exists in the hash map and whether the token has not expired yet. If true, it updates the token's expiration time by adding the currentTime to the timeToLive value.

The countUnexpiredTokens method iterates through the values (expiration times) of the hash map and increments a counter if the expiration time is greater than the currentTime. It then returns the count of unexpired tokens.

The overall complexity of this solution mainly depends on the language-specific implementation of hash maps, but in general, it is efficient in terms of both space and time complexity.

open question,"There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up, down, left or right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's position `ball` and the hole's position `hole`, where `ball = [ballrow, ballcol]` and `hole = [holerow, holecol]`, return _a string_ `instructions` _of all the instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the **shortest distance** possible_. If there are multiple valid instructions, return the **lexicographically minimum** one. If the ball can't drop in the hole, return `""impossible ""`.

If there is a way for the ball to drop in the hole, the answer `instructions` should contain the characters `'u'` (i.e., up), `'d'` (i.e., down), `'l'` (i.e., left), and `'r'` (i.e., right).

The **distance** is the number of **empty spaces** traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maze = \[\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,1,0,0,1\],\[0,1,0,0,0\]\], ball = \[4,3\], hole = \[0,1\]
**Output:**  ""lul ""
**Explanation:** There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by  ""lul "".
The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.
Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is  ""lul "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** maze = \[\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,1,0,0,1\],\[0,1,0,0,0\]\], ball = \[4,3\], hole = \[3,0\]
**Output:**  ""impossible ""
**Explanation:** The ball cannot reach the hole.

**Input:** maze = \[\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0,1,0\],\[0,0,0,0,1,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0,0,0,1\]\], ball = \[0,4\], hole = \[3,5\]

    The algorithm used to solve this problem is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with a priority queue. For each location in the maze, we store the minimal distance to reach that location along with the lexicographically smallest instructions.

We start at the ball's position and then simulate rolling it in all four directions. While rolling, we make sure that we don't go past the walls of the maze or hit a random wall, and we stop when the ball hits the hole. We update the distance and path to the location where the ball stops, only if it's shorter than the current recorded path for that location.

Since we're using a priority queue, we will always process the shortest distance location first (in case of a tie, we process the lexicographically smaller path first). This guarantees that if we reach the hole while processing a location, the resulting path will be the shortest and lexicographically smallest.

If we have visited all possible locations and don't find the hole, we return ""impossible"" as the answer.

The time complexity is O(m * n * log(m * n)) where m and n are the row and column size of the maze. The space complexity is O(m * n) since we are storing the distance and path for all the locations in the maze.

Design an algorithm to pick a random integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangle.

Any integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles should be equally likely to be returned.

    The algorithm consists of initializing a `Solution` object by storing the `rects` and calculating the area of each rectangle. The `areas` are stored, and the `total_area` is calculated by summing up all the rectangle areas.

When the `pick()` function is called, a random value, `rnd`, is generated within the range `[0, total_area-1]`. The index `idx` of the rectangle containing the point is found, adding the areas until `rnd` reaches a value less than the area of the rectangle with index `idx` (that means the rectangle at idx is the one we need). 

Next, two random integer coordinates, `x` and `y`, are generated within the range of the selected rectangle, and the point `[x, y]` is returned.

This ensures that each integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles will be equally likely to be returned.

open question,"Given an `n x n` binary `grid`, in one step you can choose two **adjacent rows** of the grid and swap them.

A grid is said to be **valid** if all the cells above the main diagonal are **zeros**.

Return _the minimum number of steps_ needed to make the grid valid, or **\-1** if the grid cannot be valid.

The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell `(1, 1)` and ends at cell `(n, n)`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1,1,0\],\[0,1,1,0\],\[0,1,1,0\],\[0,1,1,0\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** All rows are similar, swaps have no effect on the grid.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0\],\[1,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == grid.length` `== grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`","

    The algorithm first initializes steps to 0. Then, for each column i from 0 to n-1, it tries to find a row in which the cell in the current column is 0. If a row is found, it swaps this row with the previous row to move the 0 value up until the required position is reached. While doing the swaps, it increments the steps counter. If the row is not found for any column, the algorithm returns -1 as the grid cannot be valid.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `mapping` which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. `mapping[i] = j` means digit `i` should be mapped to digit `j` in this system.

The **mapped value** of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of digit `i` in the integer with `mapping[i]` for all `0 <= i <= 9`.

You are also given another integer array `nums`. Return _the array_ `nums` _sorted in **non-decreasing** order based on the **mapped values** of its elements._

**Notes:**

*   Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the **same relative order** as in the input.
*   The elements of `nums` should only be sorted based on their mapped values and **not be replaced** by them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mapping = \[8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6\], nums = \[991,338,38\]
**Output:** \[338,38,991\]
**Explanation:** 
Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping\[9\] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping\[1\] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.
Thus, the sorted array is \[338,38,991\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mapping = \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\], nums = \[789,456,123\]
**Output:** \[123,456,789\]
**Explanation:** 789 maps to 789, 456 maps to 456, and 123 maps to 123. Thus, the sorted array is \[123,456,789\].

**Constraints:**

*   `mapping.length == 10`
*   `0 <= mapping[i] <= 9`
*   All the values of `mapping[i]` are **unique**.
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`

                return -1
        else:
            i += 1
    return buckets
```

    
    The algorithm starts by initializing variables: a `buckets` counter, the current index `i`, and the length of the street `n`.

While `i` is less than the length of the street `n`, the algorithm checks for houses (the character 'H') at the current index. If there's a house, it then checks for a bucket (empty space represented by '.') in its one or two indices away, respectively. If a bucket location is found, we increment the `buckets` counter and update the index `i`. If no suitable bucket location is found, it means that it's impossible, and the algorithm returns -1.

When the index `i` is on an empty space, the algorithm simply moves to the next index `i + 1`.

The algorithm continues until the end of the string `street` is reached, and it returns the `buckets` counter as the minimum number of buckets needed.

For each pair of adjacent indices (i.e., an even index i and an odd index i+1), there are 5 * 4 = 20 combinations, so the result can be calculated as the product of the number of even indices and the number of odd indices modulo the given value (10^9 + 7).

    The algorithm starts by building a prefix map where keys are prefixes of the words in 'words' and values are the words that have that prefix. This is done to easily find words sharing the same prefix in constant time during the search.

Next, the main algorithm iterates through each word in 'words' and creates a word square using the prefix map. It starts from the first word and adds it to the square. Then, on each step, it finds all the words that share the same prefix with the current row and the previous columns. For example, if the first word is 'ball', then the second word should have the prefix 'a', because the second column must have 'area' or a word with the same prefix for the word square to be valid.

For each possible match found in the prefix map, the algorithm adds the word to the square and checks the next row. If it reaches the end, the algorithm adds the current square to the list of results. This process is repeated for each word in 'words', thus finding all valid word squares.

Finally, the list of all valid word squares is returned.

    The algorithm maintains a hashmap to store counts of the `nums2` elements. During the initialization, it populates the hashmap with the counts of each element in `nums2`.

`add` function updates the hashmap whenever an element in `nums2` is modified. It decreases the count of the original element and increases the count of the updated element.

`count` function computes the total pairs count by iterating through `nums1` and checking whether the difference `tot - nums1[i]` exists in `nums2`. If it does exist, the count of such pairs is increased by the value of `nums2Map[tot - nums1[i]]`.

All three methods use the same algorithm, and the only difference between them is the language-specific syntax and data structures used.

If there is only one node with a single occurrence, there is only one way to create a tree; hence, the function returns 1. If there are no nodes with a single occurrence, the function returns 0, since we cannot create a tree. All implementations follow this algorithm for each language.

open question,"In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

*   For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return _the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[5,4,2,1\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1,100000\]
**Output:** 100001
**Explanation:**
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 105]`.

    The main idea of the algorithm is to use dynamic programming to calculate the longest palindromic subsequence length for each possible substring. The 2D matrix `dp` is used to store the longest palindromic subsequence length for each substring in s, where `dp[i][j]` represents the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring s[i...j].

We start by initializing the diagonal of the dp matrix because single characters are always palindromic. Then we iterate through all the possible lengths of substrings (from 2 to n) and calculate the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for each substring. If the first and last characters of the substring are the same, the length increases by 2; otherwise, we take the maximum between the length without the first character and the length without the last character.

Finally, we iterate through all the possible split points in the string and calculate the product of the two non-overlapping palindromic subsequences formed by the split. We return the maximum product obtained.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of `words`.

Two strings `s1` and `s2` are said to be **connected** if the set of letters of `s2` can be obtained from the set of letters of `s1` by any **one** of the following operations:

*   Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of `s1`.
*   Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1`.
*   Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1` with any letter, **including** itself.

The array `words` can be divided into one or more non-intersecting **groups**. A string belongs to a group if any **one** of the following is true:

*   It is connected to **at least one** other string of the group.
*   It is the **only** string present in the group.

Note that the strings in `words` should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.

*   `ans[0]` _is the **maximum number** of groups_ `words` _can be divided into, and_
*   `ans[1]` _is the **size of the largest** group_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""ab "", ""cde ""\]
**Output:** \[2,3\]
**Explanation:**
- words\[0\] can be used to obtain words\[1\] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words\[2\] (by adding 'b'). So words\[0\] is connected to words\[1\] and words\[2\].
- words\[1\] can be used to obtain words\[0\] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words\[2\] (by adding 'a'). So words\[1\] is connected to words\[0\] and words\[2\].
- words\[2\] can be used to obtain words\[0\] (by deleting 'b'), and words\[1\] (by deleting 'a'). So words\[2\] is connected to words\[0\] and words\[1\].
- words\[3\] is not connected to any string in words.
Thus, words can be divided into 2 groups \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""ab ""\] and \[ ""cde ""\]. The size of the largest group is 3.

2. Iterate through the string s with index i:
   a. If the current character `s[i]` is smaller than or equal to the letter, or the letter count is greater than the repetition, enter the loop.
   b. While `pq` is not empty and the top element is greater than the current character `s[i]`, pop the top element. (In JS, pop the first element of sorted pq). Decrease the letter count if a popped element equals the given letter.
   c. Push `s[i]` to `pq` and sort the pq in JavaScript.
   d. If the size of `pq` is larger than k, pop the top element.
   e. If the difference between k and pq's size equals the repetition, decrement letter count (letter count should not be less than desired repetitions).

After sorting the items, we iterate through the sorted array to find the maximum beauty for a range of prices up to the specific index. This allows us to easily answer the queries, since now we can directly look up the maximum beauty for items up to a specific price.

Finally, we iterate through the queries, and for each query, we find the maximum beauty for the given price by accessing the result from the previously computed sorted array.

We iterate through each word (word1) in the given list of words, and then for each word1, we iterate through the list of words again (word2) to compare with word1. If word1 is different from word2 and word1 is a substring of word2, we add word1 to the resulting list and break the inner loop to avoid adding duplicates. Finally, we return the list of strings which are a substring of another word in the given list of words.

open question,"Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return _the number of the **battleships** on_ `board`.

**Battleships** can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` (`1` row, `k` columns) or `k x 1` (`k` rows, `1` column), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""X "", "". "", "". "", ""X ""\],\[ "". "", "". "", "". "", ""X ""\],\[ "". "", "". "", "". "", ""X ""\]\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "". ""\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'X'`.

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one-pass, using only `O(1)` extra memory and without modifying the values `board`?","

def countBattleships(board):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if (board[i][j] == 'X' and
                (i == 0 or board[i - 1][j] == '.') and
                (j == 0 or board[i][j - 1] == '.')):
                count += 1
    return count
```
    
    The algorithm iterates over each cell in the given `board`. If the current cell is 'X' (a battleship) and both the cell above it (if exists) and the cell to its left (if exists) are not 'X', it means we have found a new battleship. We increment the count of battleships in this case. In the end, we return the total count of battleships found.

The reason we check only the top and left cells is that we only want to count the start of a battleship, and not count the same battleship multiple times. Since the battleships can be in the horizontal or vertical direction, checking the left and top cells ensures that we count each battleship only once.

To get the moves for the next block of k 1's, we just add the difference in positions and subtract k from the current moves, as one extra move is needed to move past the last 1 in the previous k 1's.

open question,"Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a **non-empty** subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be **non-empty** after deleting one element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,-2,0,3\]

    In the synchronization solution, we use semaphores to ensure that a group of three threads containing one oxygen and two hydrogen threads pass through the barriers. In this problem, we use two semaphores, `hydrogenSemaphore` and `oxygenSemaphore`. 

We initialize the `hydrogenSemaphore` with an initial value of 2 since we need two hydrogen threads for each water molecule, this semaphore allows us to control the access for the hydrogen threads. Similarly, we initialize the `oxygenSemaphore` with an initial value of 1, to control access to the oxygen thread.

For the hydrogen function, we do the following:
- Acquire hydrogen semaphore.
- Release hydrogen.
- Release oxygen semaphore.

For the oxygen function, we do the following:
- Acquire oxygen semaphore.
- Release oxygen.
- Release hydrogen semaphore by 2 to allow the next two hydrogen threads.

By using both semaphores, we ensure that the threads pass through the barriers in complete sets of water molecules. With this approach, we control the flow of hydrogen and oxygen threads and allow them to pass the barriers in complete groups.

open question,"You are given two non-negative integer arrays `price` and `tastiness`, both arrays have the same length `n`. You are also given two non-negative integers `maxAmount` and `maxCoupons`.

For every integer `i` in range `[0, n - 1]`:

*   `price[i]` describes the price of `ith` fruit.
*   `tastiness[i]` describes the tastiness of `ith` fruit.

You want to purchase some fruits such that total tastiness is maximized and the total price does not exceed `maxAmount`.

Additionally, you can use a coupon to purchase fruit for **half of its price** (rounded down to the closest integer). You can use at most `maxCoupons` of such coupons.

Return _the maximum total tastiness that can be purchased_.

**Note that:**

*   You can purchase each fruit at most once.
*   You can use coupons on some fruit at most once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** price = \[10,20,20\], tastiness = \[5,8,8\], maxAmount = 20, maxCoupons = 1
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** It is possible to make total tastiness 13 in following way:
- Buy first fruit without coupon, so that total price = 0 + 10 and total tastiness = 0 + 5.
- Buy second fruit with coupon, so that total price = 10 + 10 and total tastiness = 5 + 8.
- Do not buy third fruit, so that total price = 20 and total tastiness = 13.
It can be proven that 13 is the maximum total tastiness that can be obtained.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** price = \[10,15,7\], tastiness = \[5,8,20\], maxAmount = 10, maxCoupons = 2
**Output:** 28
**Explanation:** It is possible to make total tastiness 20 in following way:
- Do not buy first fruit, so that total price = 0 and total tastiness = 0.
- Buy second fruit with coupon, so that total price = 0 + 7 and total tastiness = 0 + 8.
- Buy third fruit with coupon, so that total price = 7 + 3 and total tastiness = 8 + 20.
It can be proven that 28 is the maximum total tastiness that can be obtained.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == price.length == tastiness.length`

    return dp[n][maxAmount][maxCoupons]
```

    
    We solve the problem using dynamic programming. Our state is represented by three dimensions:

1. The index of the current fruit (0-based)
2. The current amount spent
3. The number of coupons used

The dp array is initialized as a 3D array filled with zeros. Then, we iterate through the fruits, updating the dp array based on whether we buy the current fruit or not, and whether we use a coupon to buy it.

For each fruit, we iterate through all possible amounts spent and all possible numbers of coupons used. We have three cases to consider when updating the dp array:

1. We do not buy the current fruit: `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j][k]`
2. We buy the current fruit without a coupon: If `j >= fruit_price`, `dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - fruit_price][k] + fruit_tastiness)`
3. We buy the current fruit with a coupon: If `k > 0 && j >= half_fruit_price`, `dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - half_fruit_price][k - 1] + fruit_tastiness)`
   
After iterating through all the fruits, amounts, and coupons, the maximum tastiness that can be obtained is stored in `dp[n][maxAmount][maxCoupons]`.

- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 2 in the tree is 2, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 2 is still 2. So the answer for the first query is \[2,2\].
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 5 in the tree is 4, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 5 is 6. So the answer for the second query is \[4,6\].

    The algorithm leverages a key observation: `(i & (i - 1))` has the same binary representation as `i`, but with the least significant `1` bit removed. This leads to a fast and efficient way to count the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of each number in the range `[0, n]`.

For each number `i` in the range `[1, n]`, we calculate `ans[i]` based on `ans[i & (i - 1)]`. Since `ans[i & (i - 1)]` is the count of `1` bits in the binary representation of `(i & (i - 1))`, adding `1` to that count will give us the count of `1` bits in the binary representation of `i`.

The algorithm iterates through the range `[1, n]` and fills the output array `ans` accordingly. The final array `ans` contains the count of `1` bits in the binary representation of each number in the range `[0, n]`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) as it iterates through the range `[1, n]` only once, and the space complexity is O(n + 1) since it creates an array of length `n + 1` to store the results.

1.  All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are **non-zero**.
2.  All other elements are 0.

Given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a square matrix, return `true` _if_ `grid` _is an X-Matrix_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[2,0,0,1\],\[0,3,1,0\],\[0,5,2,0\],\[4,0,0,2\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Refer to the diagram above. 
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is an X-Matrix.

open question,"You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every `15` minutes. The first round of the day starts at `00:00`, and after every `15` minutes, a new round starts.

*   For example, the second round starts at `00:15`, the fourth round starts at `00:45`, and the seventh round starts at `01:30`.

You are given two strings `loginTime` and `logoutTime` where:

*   `loginTime` is the time you will login to the game, and
*   `logoutTime` is the time you will logout from the game.

If `logoutTime` is **earlier** than `loginTime`, this means you have played from `loginTime` to midnight and from midnight to `logoutTime`.

Return _the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament_.

**Note:** All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at `00:00` and the last round of the day starts at `23:45`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** loginTime =  ""09:31 "", logoutTime =  ""10:14 ""
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You played one full round from 09:45 to 10:00.
You did not play the full round from 09:30 to 09:45 because you logged in at 09:31 after it began.
You did not play the full round from 10:00 to 10:15 because you logged out at 10:14 before it ended.

    The algorithm iterates through the string characters only once. For each character, it checks if it's a digit, and takes the following actions:
- If the digit is larger than the current largest digit, it assigns the previous largest digit to be the second largest digit and updates the largest digit.
- If the digit is not equal to the largest digit and larger than the current second largest digit, it updates the second largest digit.

This way, by the end of the iteration, we have the largest and second largest digits, and we return the second largest digit. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, you must determine the size of the **minimum sized** non-empty subarray of `nums` starting at `i` (**inclusive**) that has the **maximum** possible **bitwise OR**.

*   In other words, let `Bij` be the bitwise OR of the subarray `nums[i...j]`. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at `i`, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to `max(Bik)` where `i <= k <= n - 1`.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _of size_ `n` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the length of the **minimum** sized subarray starting at_ `i` _with **maximum** bitwise OR._

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,0,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[3,3,2,2,1\]
**Explanation:**
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is \[1,0,2\].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is \[0,2,1\].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is \[2,1\].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is \[1,3\].
- Starting at index 4, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is \[3\].
Therefore, we return \[3,3,2,2,1\]. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2\]

**Explanation:**
Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 2.
Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 1.
Therefore, we return \[2,1\].

```
    
    The algorithm uses two pointers `i` and `j` to process the array `nums`. For each index `i`, it will compute the bitwise OR `orSum` using the current value `nums[i]`. Then, in the inner loop, we check if the bitwise OR including `nums[j]` is the same as the current `orSum`. If so, we remove `nums[j]` from `orSum` by XOR and increment the pointer `j`.

We calculate the minimum size of the subarray that has the maximum bitwise OR at index `i` by subtracting `j` from `i` and adding 2. This will give us the current minimum size starting at the current position `i`.

The outer loop moves `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, ensuring that every index is accounted for.

At the end of each iteration, the corresponding bitwise OR value will be stored in the `answer` array. Finally, we return the `answer` array, containing the length of the minimum-sized subarray starting at `i` with the maximum bitwise OR.

The keys will represent the different anagrams, while the values will be lists of the original strings that fit the anagram. Finally, extract the values (lists of anagrams) from the map or dictionary and return them. This works because anagrams will produce the same sorted strings as keys.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a **single row** of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red `'R'`, yellow `'Y'`, blue `'B'`, green `'G'`, or white `'W'`. You also have several colored balls in your hand.

Your goal is to **clear all** of the balls from the board. On each turn:

*   Pick **any** ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
*   If there is a group of **three or more consecutive balls** of the **same color**, remove the group of balls from the board.
    *   If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
*   If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
*   Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

**Explanation:** It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =  ""WWRRBBWW "", hand =  ""WRBRW ""
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach along with memoization. The base case for the recursion is when there is an empty board, in which case the minimum number of balls to clear the board is 0.

The function loops through the board to find sequences of the same color. For each sequence, it calculates the number of balls needed to reach at least 3 in a row. If the required number of balls are available in hand, it removes the required balls from hand and proceeds recursively with the rest of the board.

After the recursive call, the removed balls are added back to the hand.

The memoization is used to store the results of subproblems based on the current state of the board.

The result is -1 if the balls in hand cannot clear the board, otherwise, the minimum number of balls required to clear the board is returned.

    We first compute the total number of products by summing up the values in the `quantities` array. In C++ and Java, we do this by looping through the array and adding each value to a running total. In Python, we use the built-in `sum()` function, while in JavaScript, we use the `reduce()` function.

After we have the total number of products, we calculate the minimum possible x by dividing the total number of products by the number of specialty retail stores and rounding up to the nearest integer. In C++ and Java, we do this using integer division, adding `n - 1` to the total number of products to ensure that the result is rounded up. In Python, we use floor division (`//`), which also ensures that the result is rounded up. In JavaScript, we use `Math.floor()` for rounding.

Finally, we return the minimum possible x, which represents the minimum number of products per store.

**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.

    We iterate through the input array `strs`. For each string, we check whether it contains only digits or not. If it contains only digits, we find its numeric value and store it in a variable `value`. If it contains other characters (letters), we store its length in the `value` variable. In each iteration, we update the `max_value` variable with the maximum of the current `max_value` and the `value` found.

open question,"You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

We call an integer `k` fair if the number of **even** digits in `k` is equal to the number of **odd** digits in it.

Return _the **smallest** fair integer that is **greater than or equal** to_ `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The smallest fair integer that is greater than or equal to 2 is 10.
10 is fair because it has an equal number of even and odd digits (one odd digit and one even digit).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 403
**Output:** 1001
**Explanation:** The smallest fair integer that is greater than or equal to 403 is 1001.
1001 is fair because it has an equal number of even and odd digits (two odd digits and two even digits).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 109`","

    while True:
        k = n

            k //= 10
        if even == odd:
            return n
        n += 1
```
    
    The algorithm starts from the given number `n` and check if it is fair or not. A fair number `k` is the one where the count of even digits is equal to the count of odd digits.

To check if a number is fair, we count the even and odd digits of the number `k` using a while loop. In each iteration, we check if the last digit of `k` is even or odd, increment the respective counter, and update `k` by removing the last digit. If the count of even and odd digits is equal, return the number `n`.

If the given number `n` is not fair, we increment `n` and repeat the process until we find a fair number.

This algorithm has a linear time complexity (in the worst case) as we need to find the subsequent fair numbers one by one until we find the smallest fair number satisfying the constraints.

We create a 4D dp table to store the answer. The dimensions in the dp table represent the range start (l), range end (r), iterator (k), and the last balanced range. We initialize the dp table accordingly. We iterate over the length of nums1 and consider each possible subarrays of nums1 and nums2. Inside the nested loop, we compute the left and right sums of nums1 and nums2 for each range, and we check if the given range is balanced by matching the required conditions. If the range is balanced, we loop through the last 3 balanced ranges and update the dp table accordingly. Finally, we return the answer.

    This problem can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. We can start by creating a helper function (a recursive function) that will iterate through all possibilities. The base case for the recursion is when the current index (idx) is greater than the given integer n. When this condition is met, increment the result (res) by 1.

In the helper function, iterate a loop for each integer i (1 <= i <= n). Check if i is not visited (visited[i] == false) and if i is divisible by idx or idx is divisible by i. If either of these conditions is true, mark i as visited and call the helper function recursively with the index incremented by 1. After the recursive call, unmark i as visited to backtrack to the previous state.

Initially, pass an array or vector of visited flags, which are all initialized to false along with the integer n and index 1 to the helper function. The helper function will traverse all possibilities and return the result (res) as the final count of beautiful arrangements.

The **sum of squared difference** of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the **sum** of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])2` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.

    The algorithm involves iterating through the grid and computing the minimum sum for each element, considering only the adjacent elements in the previous row that have non-zero shifts (elements with different column indices than the current element). 

We first iterate through the rows of grid (starting at row 1, because the base case is row 0). Then, we iterate through the columns in each row, calculating the minimum sum value for each element at grid[i][j] by iterating through all the elements in the previous row (grid[i - 1][k]) and choosing the element with the minimum sum that isn't in the same column (k != j). We then add the calculated minimum sum value to the current element grid[i][j] to update it. 

After traversal of the whole grid, we return the minimum value in the last row of grid, as this value now represents the minimum sum of the falling path with non-zero shifts.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the dimension of the grid, since we are using three nested loops to iterate through the elements of the grid. The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures.

    The algorithm uses Depth First Search (DFS) to search for each word in the board. For each word, we iterate through all the cells in the board and start the DFS search if the current cell matches the word's first letter. During the DFS search, we mark the cell as visited and only continue the search if the next cell we are going to move to is not yet visited, in the allowed board bounds, and it matches the next character of the word. If we reached the end of the word, then we know that this word is found in the board.

For each programming language, we implemented the `findWords` function that takes the `board` and the `words` as an input and returns a list of found words. The core algorithm is the same, but the language-specific syntax and constructs are used accordingly.

open question,"As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `strength`, where `strength[i]` denotes the strength of the `ith` wizard. For a **contiguous** group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a **subarray** of `strength`), the **total strength** is defined as the **product** of the following two values:

*   The strength of the **weakest** wizard in the group.
*   The **total** of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.

Return _the **sum** of the total strengths of **all** contiguous groups of wizards_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strength = \[1,3,1,2\]
**Output:** 44
**Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
- \[1\] from \[**1**,3,1,2\] has a total strength of min(\[1\]) \* sum(\[1\]) = 1 \* 1 = 1
- \[3\] from \[1,**3**,1,2\] has a total strength of min(\[3\]) \* sum(\[3\]) = 3 \* 3 = 9
- \[1\] from \[1,3,**1**,2\] has a total strength of min(\[1\]) \* sum(\[1\]) = 1 \* 1 = 1
- \[2\] from \[1,3,1,**2**\] has a total strength of min(\[2\]) \* sum(\[2\]) = 2 \* 2 = 4
- \[1,3\] from \[**1,3**,1,2\] has a total strength of min(\[1,3\]) \* sum(\[1,3\]) = 1 \* 4 = 4
- \[3,1\] from \[1,**3,1**,2\] has a total strength of min(\[3,1\]) \* sum(\[3,1\]) = 1 \* 4 = 4
- \[1,2\] from \[1,3,**1,2**\] has a total strength of min(\[1,2\]) \* sum(\[1,2\]) = 1 \* 3 = 3
- \[1,3,1\] from \[**1,3,1**,2\] has a total strength of min(\[1,3,1\]) \* sum(\[1,3,1\]) = 1 \* 5 = 5
- \[3,1,2\] from \[1,**3,1,2**\] has a total strength of min(\[3,1,2\]) \* sum(\[3,1,2\]) = 1 \* 6 = 6
- \[1,3,1,2\] from \[**1,3,1,2**\] has a total strength of min(\[1,3,1,2\]) \* sum(\[1,3,1,2\]) = 1 \* 7 = 7
The sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strength = \[5,4,6\]
**Output:** 213
**Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: 
- \[5\] from \[**5**,4,6\] has a total strength of min(\[5\]) \* sum(\[5\]) = 5 \* 5 = 25
- \[4\] from \[5,**4**,6\] has a total strength of min(\[4\]) \* sum(\[4\]) = 4 \* 4 = 16
- \[6\] from \[5,4,**6**\] has a total strength of min(\[6\]) \* sum(\[6\]) = 6 \* 6 = 36
- \[5,4\] from \[**5,4**,6\] has a total strength of min(\[5,4\]) \* sum(\[5,4\]) = 4 \* 9 = 36
- \[4,6\] from \[5,**4,6**\] has a total strength of min(\[4,6\]) \* sum(\[4,6\]) = 4 \* 10 = 40
- \[5,4,6\] from \[**5,4,6**\] has a total strength of min(\[5,4,6\]) \* sum(\[5,4,6\]) = 4 \* 15 = 60
The sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.

    return res
```
    
    The given problem can be solved by iterating over each wizard in the array. For each wizard, we will find the contiguous subarrays that end at that wizard (the wizard is the last element in the subarray). For this, we will iterate from the current wizard to the end of the array, calculating the minimum strength and total strength of the subarray in each step. We then update the result by adding the product of the current subarray's minimum strength and total strength, and take the result modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers. At the end, we return the result after checking all the wizards and their respective contiguous subarrays.

    The algorithm performs a post-order traversal, visiting each node of the tree. It starts with the root of the tree and checks whether it's a root node or not. If it's a root node, it adds the node to the forest; otherwise, it continues traversal. Left and right children are updated for each node. If a node's value is found in the `to_delete` list, this function returns nullptr (Python: None, JavaScript: null, Java: null) otherwise, it returns the current node. This way, the tree nodes will be combined with their new parents after the deletion, and the forest will have the roots of the disjoint trees.

    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. 
1. Create a `dp` array of the length of the strings in the input array, initialized with 1.
2. Loop through the characters of the string elements twice (using two nested loops with indices `i` and `j`).
3. For every pair of characters (strs[k][i] and strs[k][j]), check if i-th characters of all the strings are less than or equal to j-th characters in lexicographic order. If this condition is satisfied for all the i-th and j-th characters, update the value of dp[j] with the maximum of its current value and dp[i] + 1.
4. The minimum number of deletion indices is the difference between the length of the strings in the input array and the maximum value in the `dp` array.

This approach ensures a dynamic update of the `dp` array by keeping track of the valid pairs of indices where lexicographic order is maintained. The final maximum value in the `dp` array represents the longest valid sequence of characters with lexicographic order maintained. The difference between this value and the length of the strings gives us the required minimum deletion indices to achieve lexicographic order.

    The algorithm consists of performing a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the given tree starting from the root node (i.e. node 0). While traversing the tree, maintain a count array to keep track of the labels of the visited nodes. When visiting a node, store the current count of the node's label and increment the count, then visit its child nodes. Calculate the answer for the current node by subtracting the previous count from the updated count. After visiting all the children of a node, restore the previous count of the node's label so that it has the correct count when visiting the siblings in the higher level of the tree traversal. Finally, return the answer vector containing the count of nodes with the same label for each node in their corresponding subtree.

    The algorithm first initializes an empty tree structure and the resulting array `ans`. Each subtree is represented by a set that will store the genetic values of the nodes in the subtree.

The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the tree, starting from the root node (node 0). For each node in the tree, it first adds the node's genetic value to its subtree set. Then, for each child of the current node, the `dfs` function is called recursively to explore the descendant nodes. The sets of the child nodes are then merged into the set of the current node.

To find the smallest missing genetic value, an integer `missing` is initialized to 1. A while loop is used to iterate through the values in the current node's subtree set. If a value equal to `missing` is found in the set, `missing` is incremented. If not, the iteration is stopped, and the value of `missing` is assigned to the corresponding position in the resulting array `ans`.

Once the DFS is completed, the function returns the array `ans`.

open question,"You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from `nums` satisfying the following conditions:

*   The 2D array should contain **only** the elements of the array `nums`.
*   Each row in the 2D array contains **distinct** integers.
*   The number of rows in the 2D array should be **minimal**.

Return _the resulting array_. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note** that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,4,1,2,3,1\]

**Explanation:** We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:

- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]

    The algorithm iterates through the input array (`nums`). For each number in `nums`, it checks if the number can be inserted in any existing row in the result without violating the distinct condition. If yes, it inserts the number in the first available row; if not, it creates a new row with that number. Finally, it converts the sets containing distinct numbers into arrays/Lists and returns the resulting 2D array.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. In the worst case, every number in `nums` would need to be inserted in a separate row, resulting in n separate iterations for each number. However, in practice, the algorithm's performance is usually better than the worst-case scenario.

Given an array of integers `nums`, return _the sum of the **widths** of all the non-empty **subsequences** of_ `nums`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Next, we loop through the columns (starting with the second), and for each column, we calculate the count of 1s. If the count is less than or equal to half the number of rows, we toggle the entire column.

Finally, we loop through the modified grid again, summing up the binary numbers represented by each row to get the highest possible score.

    The algorithm consists of sorting the `nums` array in ascending order. Then, we iterate over the array from index 1 to the end. If the current element is greater than the one before it, we swap them and increase the greatness counter. This ensures that at each step, we have the maximum possible greatness for the current element. The algorithm takes advantage of the sorted array to perform permutations in a greedy manner, maximizing greatness at each step. The final result is the maximum greatness possible.

open question,"You have a convex `n`\-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex (i.e., **clockwise order**).

You will **triangulate** the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `n - 2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return _the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** values = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** values = \[3,7,4,5\]
**Output:** 144
**Explanation:** There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3\*7\*5 + 4\*5\*7 = 245, or 3\*4\*5 + 3\*4\*7 = 144.
The minimum score is 144.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** values = \[1,3,1,4,1,5\]

3. We then iterate through the `trustCounts` array from 1 to n (inclusive). If the trust count for person 'i' is `n - 1`, this means that every other person trusts 'i', and 'i' trusts no one else. In this case, 'i' is the town judge and we return 'i'.

*   An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
*   A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
*   A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like `""2x ""` or `""-x ""`.

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

*   For example, `expression = ""1 + 2 * 3 ""` has an answer of `[ ""7 ""]`.

The format of the output is as follows:

*   For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
    *   For example, we would never write a term like `""b*a*c ""`, only `""a*b*c ""`.
*   Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
    *   For example, `""a*a*b*c ""` has degree `4`.
*   The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
*   An example of a well-formatted answer is `[ ""-2*a*a*a "", ""3*a*a*b "", ""3*b*b "", ""4*a "", ""5*c "", ""-6 ""]`.

open question,"A string `s` can be partitioned into groups of size `k` using the following procedure:

*   The first group consists of the first `k` characters of the string, the second group consists of the next `k` characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of **exactly one** group.
*   For the last group, if the string **does not** have `k` characters remaining, a character `fill` is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the `fill` character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Given the string `s`, the size of each group `k` and the character `fill`, return _a string array denoting the **composition of every group**_ `s` _has been divided into, using the above procedure_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcdefghi "", k = 3, fill =  ""x ""
**Output:** \[ ""abc "", ""def "", ""ghi ""\]
**Explanation:**
The first 3 characters  ""abc "" form the first group.
The next 3 characters  ""def "" form the second group.
The last 3 characters  ""ghi "" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
Thus, the groups formed are  ""abc "",  ""def "", and  ""ghi "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcdefghij "", k = 3, fill =  ""x ""
**Output:** \[ ""abc "", ""def "", ""ghi "", ""jxx ""\]
**Explanation:**
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups  ""abc "",  ""def "", and  ""ghi "".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.

We will have a 2D array `dp[i][j]` that represents the number of ways to arrange i sticks such that exactly j sticks are visible from the left. We initialize `dp[i][1] = 1` for all i, because there is always 1 way to arrange i sticks such that only 1 stick is visible from the left (placing the largest stick at the beginning).

Now let's fill out the dp array iteratively. At each step, we can either make the current stick visible or not visible. If we make the stick visible, there would be `dp[i-1][j-1]` ways to arrange the remaining sticks, since there are now j-1 visible sticks needed for the first i-1 sticks. If we don't make the stick visible, there would be `(i-1) * dp[i-1][j]` ways to arrange the remaining sticks, because there are still j visible sticks needed but there are now i-1 positions to place the current stick (it can be placed behind any of the first i-1 sticks). We add these two cases together and take the result modulo 10^9+7.

open question,"Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

You are also given the helper object `Master`. You may call `Master.guess(word)` where `word` is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from `words`. `Master.guess(word)` returns:

There is a parameter `allowedGuesses` for each test case where `allowedGuesses` is the maximum number of times you can call `Master.guess(word)`.

For each test case, you should call `Master.guess` with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

1. Sort the input array so that we can iterate through it in ascending order.
2. Initialize a hash map `dp` for dynamic programming, where the key is an element in the array and the value is the count of trees we can create using that element as root.
3. For each element `x` in the array, we start with a count of 1 because there's always a possibility of having a tree with just the root.
4. For each smaller element `y` in the array, if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), we check if there's another element `z` in the array such that `y * z == x`. If so, we update the count of trees for `x` as `dp[x] + dp[y] * dp[z]` in a modulo manner.

    The algorithm starts by finding the minimum value present in the `nums` array. Then, it iterates through `target` values within the range `[base, base + 1]` because we only need to check the minimum value and potential next minimum value. For each possible `target`, calculate the local result by iterating through the elements in the `nums` array and multiplying the absolute difference between the current element and target by the corresponding cost element. Update the global minimum cost if the local result is smaller than the current global minimum.

open question,"You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

*   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,3,5,7\],\[10,11,16,20\],\[23,30,34,60\]\], target = 3

    The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

If the search space has been fully explored and the target is not found, we return false.

    The algorithm uses a sliding window approach. It maintains a set `elements` to keep track of unique integers in the current window. The set is updated accordingly as the window slides through the input array. The `current_sum` variable is updated by adding the current integer to the sum and then subtracting the integers that are no longer in the window. The `max_sum` keeps track of the maximum score seen so far.

As we iterate through the input array, we check if the current integer is already in the set. If it is, we remove the leftmost integer from the set and slide the window to the next element. We also update the `current_sum` appropriately. If the current integer is not in the set, we add it to the set, update the `current_sum`, and update the `max_sum` with the maximum value between the current and previous maximum sums.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** `8 x 8` grid `board`, where `board[r][c]` represents the cell `(r, c)` on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by `'.'`, white cells are represented by `'W'`, and black cells are represented by `'B'`.

Each move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only **legal** if, after changing it, the cell becomes the **endpoint of a good line** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

A **good line** is a line of **three or more cells (including the endpoints)** where the endpoints of the line are **one color**, and the remaining cells in the middle are the **opposite color** (no cells in the line are free). You can find examples for good lines in the figure below:

Given two integers `rMove` and `cMove` and a character `color` representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return `true` _if changing cell_ `(rMove, cMove)` _to color_ `color` _is a **legal** move, or_ `false` _if it is not legal_.

**Input:** s =  ""abcd "", indices = \[0, 2\], sources = \[ ""a "",  ""cd ""\], targets = \[ ""eee "",  ""ffff ""\]
**Output:**  ""eeebffff ""
**Explanation:**
 ""a "" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with  ""eee "".
 ""cd "" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with  ""ffff "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcd "", indices = \[0, 2\], sources = \[ ""ab "", ""ec ""\], targets = \[ ""eee "", ""ffff ""\]
**Output:**  ""eeecd ""
**Explanation:**
 ""ab "" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with  ""eee "".
 ""ec "" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `k == indices.length == sources.length == targets.length`
*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `0 <= indexes[i] < s.length`
*   `1 <= sources[i].length, targets[i].length <= 50`

*   The value of each item in `items` is **unique**.

Return _a 2D integer array_ `ret` _where_ `ret[i] = [valuei, weighti]`_,_ _with_ `weighti` _being the **sum of weights** of all items with value_ `valuei`.

**Output:** \[\[1,6\],\[3,9\],\[4,5\]\]
**Explanation:** 
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.

open question,"You are given an array of positive integers `arr`. Perform some operations (possibly none) on `arr` so that it satisfies these conditions:

*   The value of the **first** element in `arr` must be `1`.
*   The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be **less than or equal to** `1`. In other words, `abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1` for each `i` where `1 <= i < arr.length` (**0-indexed**). `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

There are 2 types of operations that you can perform any number of times:

*   **Decrease** the value of any element of `arr` to a **smaller positive integer**.
*   **Rearrange** the elements of `arr` to be in any order.

Return _the **maximum** possible value of an element in_ `arr` _after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[2,2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
We can satisfy the conditions by rearranging `arr` so it becomes `[1,2,2,2,1]`.
The largest element in `arr` is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[100,1,1000\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
One possible way to satisfy the conditions is by doing the following:
1. Rearrange `arr` so it becomes `[1,100,1000]`.
2. Decrease the value of the second element to 2.
3. Decrease the value of the third element to 3.
Now `arr = [1,2,3], which` satisfies the conditions.
The largest element in `arr is 3.`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The array already satisfies the conditions, and the largest element is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= arr[i] <= 109`","

        arr[i] = min(arr[i], arr[i - 1] + 1)
    return arr[-1]
```
    
    The main idea of this algorithm is to sort the array and modify it following these steps:
1. Set the first element to 1.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element. For each element, set its value to the minimum of its current value and the value of the previous element plus one.

Since we sort the array, the absolute difference between adjacent elements after this transformation will always satisfy the conditions. Sorting ensures that we decrement the values as little as possible.

Our goal is to return the maximum value, which will be the last element of the array after modifying it in this way.

open question,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""a "". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  ""bc "". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[4,1\]
**Output:** \[3,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`","

        return cnt

    def read4(self, buf4):
        return 0
```
    
    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.

The algorithm checks if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root` by first looking whether the two trees have the same root node. If they do, it checks whether the substructures are also identical. If they are not, then `subRoot` is not a subtree at this level, and the algorithm looks further down the left and right branches of `root`. This is done by returning the logical `OR` between the result of checking left and right branches.

The helper function `isIdentical` checks whether the two given trees have the same structure and node values, by comparing the current nodes and then recursively traversing the left and right substructures. If a `None` value for a node is found, the two nodes are identical if they are both `None`. Otherwise, if the node values differ, the trees are not identical.

    For each language implementation, the algorithm follows the process below:

1. Convert the given `edges` into an adjacency list representation (a list with a set of neighbors for each node).
2. Initialize the `cache` (a 2D array) to store the largest color value of valid paths from a node considering the color of that node.
3. Calculate the `inDegree` (number of incoming edges) for every node.
4. Initialize the variable `res` to -1 (it will store the largest color value).
5. Iterate through all the nodes, and for each node with an `inDegree` of 0 (no incoming edges) call the `dfs` function.
6. In the `dfs` function, use depth-first search to traverse the directed graph and compute the largest color value of valid paths from a node considering the color of that node using memoization (storing it in `cache` to avoid recomputation).
7. Update `res` with the maximum of its current value and the color value returned by the `dfs` function for a given node.
8. Return `res` (the largest color value of any valid path in the graph).

The DFS function is used to compute the largest color value of any valid path in the graph for a given node. The memoization (caching) technique is used to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the time complexity of the algorithm.

open question,"There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return _the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
**Output:** 19
**Explanation:** You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.

        totalBottles += newBottles
        numBottles = newBottles + numBottles % numExchange
    return totalBottles
```
    
    The algorithm initializes the totalBottles variable with the value of numBottles. It then uses a while loop to repeatedly calculate the number of new full bottles the person can get by exchanging the current number of empty bottles.

In each iteration, the loop calculates the new number of full bottles by dividing numBottles by numExchange and flooring the result. It then adds these new bottles to the totalBottles variable. The loop also updates the number of empty bottles by adding the new full bottles and the remainder of numBottles divided by numExchange.

Once the number of empty bottles is less than the required numExchange, the loop terminates, and the function returns the value of totalBottles as the maximum number of water bottles the person can drink.

open question,"There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in **clockwise order**. More formally, moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the `1st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1.  **Start** at the `1st` friend.
2.  Count the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction **including** the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
3.  The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
4.  If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step `2` **starting** from the friend **immediately clockwise** of the friend who just lost and repeat.
5.  Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

open question,"You are given two **positive** integers `startPos` and `endPos`. Initially, you are standing at position `startPos` on an **infinite** number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.

Given a positive integer `k`, return _the number of **different** ways to reach the position_ `endPos` _starting from_ `startPos`_, such that you perform **exactly**_ `k` _steps_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.

**Note** that the number line includes negative integers.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** startPos = 1, endPos = 2, k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can reach position 2 from 1 in exactly 3 steps in three ways:
- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2.
- 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2.
- 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2.
It can be proven that no other way is possible, so we return 3.

**Input:** startPos = 2, endPos = 5, k = 10
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** It is impossible to reach position 5 from position 2 in exactly 10 steps.

    if startPos < 0 or endPos < 0 or startPos >= MAX or endPos >= MAX: return 0

    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(MAX)]
    return ways(startPos, endPos, k, dp)
```
    
    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a helper function `ways(startPos, endPos, k, dp)` to calculate the number of different ways to reach the position `endPos` from `startPos` with `k` steps remaining. The `dp` parameter is a memoization table, and stores the calculated results.

The base condition of the recursion is when `k == 0`, which means we have used up all our steps. If `startPos` is equal to `endPos`, it means we have reached the desired position using `k` steps, and we return 1, otherwise, we return 0.

If `startPos` or `endPos` is out of the given bounds, we return 0 as it is not possible to reach the destination in that case.

We check if the current state (`startPos` and `k`) has already been calculated, if so, we return the value from the memoization table.

We make a recursive call by moving one step to the left (`ways(startPos - 1, endPos, k - 1, dp)`), and one step to the right (`ways(startPos + 1, endPos, k - 1, dp)`), and sum the results modulo `MOD`. This sum represents the number of different ways to reach `endPos` from current `startPos` with remaining `k` steps.

We store and return the calculated result for the current state (`startPos` and `k`) in the memoization table.

The main `numberOfWays` function just initializes the memoization table `dp` and calls the `ways` function with the given input parameters.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

1.  **Divide** `s` into **consecutive groups** of size `k` such that the first `k` characters are in the first group, the next `k` characters are in the second group, and so on. **Note** that the size of the last group can be smaller than `k`.
2.  **Replace** each group of `s` with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, `""346 ""` is replaced with `""13 ""` because `3 + 4 + 6 = 13`.
3.  **Merge** consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than `k`, repeat from step `1`.

Return `s` _after all rounds have been completed_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""11111222223 "", k = 3
**Output:**  ""135 ""
**Explanation:** 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3:  ""111 "",  ""112 "",  ""222 "", and  ""23 "".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes  ""3 "" +  ""4 "" +  ""6 "" +  ""5 "" =  ""3465 "" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into  ""346 "" and  ""5 "".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes  ""13 "" +  ""5 "" =  ""135 "" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return  ""135 "" as the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""00000000 "", k = 3
**Output:**  ""000 ""
**Explanation:** 
We divide s into  ""000 "",  ""000 "", and  ""00 "".
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes  ""0 "" +  ""0 "" +  ""0 "" =  ""000 "", whose length is equal to k, so we return  ""000 "".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `2 <= k <= 100`
*   `s` consists of digits only.","

```
    
    The algorithm iterates through each character in the given string `s`. It maintains a variable called `lastIndexA` that keeps track of the last index where the character 'a' is found. If it encounters 'a', it updates `lastIndexA` with the current index. If it encounters 'b' and `lastIndexA` is not set to `-1` (meaning there was an 'a' before it), the algorithm returns `false`. If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means that every 'a' appears before every 'b', so the algorithm returns `true`.

open question,"Given an array `nums` and an integer `target`, return _the maximum number of **non-empty** **non-overlapping** subarrays such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to_ `target`.

On each iteration, we calculate the sum of elements and then check if the (current sum - target) exists in the prefix sum hashmap. If it exists, it means we have a subarray that sums to the target, so we update our count. We also make sure to only consider non-overlapping subarrays by storing the current max count in the hashmap.

After initializing the DP and the required mappings/arrays, we loop through each person and find their skill mask. Then we loop backwards from the maximum bitmask to update the DP array with the findings.

The final result is extracted by iterating through the updated DP array and storing the indices of the required team members in the `res` array. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * m * 2^m), where n is the number of people and m is the number of required skills.

open question,"You are given an integer array `nums`. The adjacent integers in `nums` will perform the float division.

*   For example, for `nums = [2,3,4]`, we will evaluate the expression `""2/3/4 ""`.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You want to add these parentheses such the value of the expression after the evaluation is maximum.

Return _the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format_.

**Note:** your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1000,100,10,2\]
**Output:**  ""1000/(100/10/2) ""
**Explanation:** 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in  ""1000/(**(**100/10**)**/2) "" are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return  ""1000/(100/10/2) "".
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,4\]
**Output:**  ""2/(3/4) ""
**Explanation:** (2/(3/4)) = 8/3 = 2.667
It can be shown that after trying all possibilities, we cannot get an expression with evaluation greater than 2.667

*   `2 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   There is only one optimal division for the given input.","

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        res += str(nums[i]) + '/'
    res += str(nums[n - 1]) + ')'
    return res
```

    
    The key to maximizing the result of the division expression is to minimize the divisors by grouping them together in parentheses. Since we want the entire array of numbers divided by the smallest possible divisor, we essentially want to maximize the division by ensuring the numbers in the array are divided by each other in sequence, from left to right.

The algorithm goes as follows:
1. If there's only one number, return that number.
2. If there are two numbers, a and b, just return ""a/b"" as the division expression.
3. For three or more numbers, create a string with the first number followed by ""/("".
4. Iterate through the rest of the numbers, adding each number to the string followed by a ""/"". Stop at the second-to-last number in the array.
5. Add the very last number to the string followed by a closing parenthesis.
6. Return the constructed string.

This way, we get the maximum value for the division operation.

    The algorithm uses a recursive depth-first search with memoization to find the shortest sequence of instructions to reach the target position from the initial position (0) with a speed of 1. At each step, the algorithm considers both reversing the direction and accelerating, making the minimal choice of the two options.

Memoization is used to store the results of previous calculations for each position and speed combination, thus avoiding repeated time-consuming calculations and ensuring that the overall complexity is minimal.

The base case of the recursion is reached when the position is equal to the target, and the algorithm returns either 0 if the speed=1 or 1 if the speed is not equal to 1 (meaning that the algorithm needs to reverse the direction). This base case helps to calculate the results for upper levels of the recursion.

Overall, this depth-first search with memoization efficiently calculates the shortest sequence of moves to reach the target position.

    The reconstruction of binary tree can be done using a divide-and-conquer strategy.

1. The first element of the preorder array is the root node.
2. The second element of the preorder array is the root of the left subtree.
3. Find the index of the left subtree root in the postorder array. The left subtree size can be calculated as `index - postStart + 1`.
4. The left subtree ranges can be found using `preStart + 1` and `preStart + 1 + leftSize` in the preorder array, `postStart` and `postStart + leftSize` in the postorder array.
5. The right subtree ranges can be found with `preStart + 1 + leftSize` and `preEnd` in the preorder array, `postStart + leftSize` and `postEnd - 1` in the postorder array.
6. Recursively build the left subtree and right subtree with the calculated ranges.
7. Connect the left subtree and right subtree to the current root node.

The overall time complexity is O(N^2) due to finding the index of the left subtree root. The space complexity is O(N) because of the recursion stack.

In the recoverTree() function, if the passed node is null, then we simply return. Otherwise, we assign the provided value `val` to the node and add it to the set `values`. After that, we make recursive calls to recoverTree() for left and right children of the node with updated values according to the given rules (val * 2 + 1 for left child and val * 2 + 2 for right child).

The find() function checks if the target value exists in the `values` set, returning true if it exists, and false otherwise.

open question,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  ""shall be     "" instead of  ""shall     be "", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

    The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize an empty result list.
2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.
8. Return the result list.

open question,"The **minimum absolute difference** of an array `a` is defined as the **minimum value** of `|a[i] - a[j]|`, where `0 <= i < j < a.length` and `a[i] != a[j]`. If all elements of `a` are the **same**, the minimum absolute difference is `-1`.

*   For example, the minimum absolute difference of the array `[5,2,3,7,2]` is `|2 - 3| = 1`. Note that it is not `0` because `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be different.

You are given an integer array `nums` and the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`. For each query `i`, compute the **minimum absolute difference** of the **subarray** `nums[li...ri]` containing the elements of `nums` between the **0-based** indices `li` and `ri` (**inclusive**).

Return _an **array**_ `ans` _where_ `ans[i]` _is the answer to the_ `ith` _query_.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

*   `x` if `x >= 0`.
*   `-x` if `x < 0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,4,8\], queries = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[0,3\]\]
**Output:** \[2,1,4,1\]

- queries\[0\] = \[0,1\]: The subarray is \[1,3\] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-3| = 2.
- queries\[1\] = \[1,2\]: The subarray is \[3,4\] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
- queries\[2\] = \[2,3\]: The subarray is \[4,8\] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-8| = 4.
- queries\[3\] = \[0,3\]: The subarray is \[1,3,4,8\] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,2,2,7,10\], queries = \[\[2,3\],\[0,2\],\[0,5\],\[3,5\]\]
**Output:** \[-1,1,1,3\]
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
- queries\[0\] = \[2,3\]: The subarray is \[2,2\] and the minimum absolute difference is -1 because all the
  elements are the same.
- queries\[1\] = \[0,2\]: The subarray is \[4,5,2\] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-5| = 1.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming (DP) and depth-first search (DFS) to solve the problem. We create a DP array to store the maximum score for each indexed operation. 

In each DFS step, we iterate over the next index, calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current two numbers, and multiply it by the operation counter (1-indexed). The algorithm continues recursively, and the base case is reached when the operation counter is greater than n (the number of operations), in which case we return 0.

The final maximum score is calculated by taking the maximum of the current answer and the result of the inner DFS step. In the end, the DP array stores and memorizes the calculated score to avoid repetitive calculations. The result is obtained by calling DFS with arguments 1 and 0.

In one operation, you can move **any** item to the empty space. `nums` is considered to be sorted if the numbers of all the items are in **ascending** order and the empty space is either at the beginning or at the end of the array.

For example, if `n = 4`, `nums` is sorted if:

**Input:** seats = \[1,0,0,0,1,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats\[2\]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** seats = \[1,0,0,0\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats\[3\]), the closest person is 3 seats away.

    We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Start with two base cases: 

1. If there are no floors (n=0), the minimum moves required is 0.
2. If there is only one floor (n=1), the minimum moves required is 1.

Create an array `dp` with `n+1` elements, initializing `dp[0]` to 0 and `dp[1]` to 1.

For each floor `i` from 2 to `n`, start with `dp[i]` as `i`. For each potential drop floor `x` from 1 to `i-1`, we can calculate the number of moves required as the maximum moves between when the egg breaks (`x-1`) and when the egg doesn't break (`i-x`), plus 1 for the current move. Update `dp[i]` as the minimum between its current value and the calculated number of moves.

Once we have processed all floors, `dp[n]` contains the minimum number of moves required to determine floor `f` with certainty.

You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only contains digits, `'?'`, `':'`, `'T'`, and `'F'` where `'T'` is true and `'F'` is false. All the numbers in the expression are **one-digit** numbers (i.e., in the range `[0, 9]`).

open question,"You are controlling a robot that is located somewhere in a room. The room is modeled as an `m x n` binary grid where `0` represents a wall and `1` represents an empty slot.

The robot starts at an unknown location in the room that is guaranteed to be empty, and you do not have access to the grid, but you can move the robot using the given API `Robot`.

You are tasked to use the robot to clean the entire room (i.e., clean every empty cell in the room). The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn is `90` degrees.

When the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using the following APIs:

interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}

**Note** that the initial direction of the robot will be facing up. You can assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by a wall.

**Custom testing:**

The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must solve this problem ""blindfolded "". In other words, you must control the robot using only the four mentioned APIs without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.

**Output:** Robot cleaned all rooms.
**Explanation:** All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.

    The algorithm starts at the given location and loops through all possible paths until it reaches the destination cell, by only taking a right or down step. At each step, it compares the current path with lexicographically smaller path, and proceeds in either of the directions based on check conditions. In order to get the kth lexicographically smallest instruction, we use mathematical combination method to check if taking the horizontal step satisfies the condition or not. If it does, we take the horizontal step; otherwise, we take the vertical step.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(row + col), where row and col are the coordinates of the destination cell, because we need to go through entire cells in row and column.

open question,"You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

    For this problem, the algorithm iterates through the string, keeping track of the required depth, which is initialized to 0. We use depth as an indicator of how balanced the parentheses are at each step.

When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', the depth is increased by 2. This is because, in order to balance a single '(', we need 2 closing parentheses '))'.

When encountering a closing parenthesis ')', if the previous character is an opening parenthesis '(', decrease depth by 1, because this represents a partially balanced pair. However, if the previous character is another closing parenthesis ')', we decrease depth by 2, as we have a closed pair '))'.

If at any point the depth becomes negative, we adjust the answer and depth back to 0. At the end, we return the resultant answer updated with the remaining depth.

Overall, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

    We first generate a random radius `r` within the circle by generating a random value between 0 and 1, taking the square root of the value, and multiplying it with the circle's `radius`. We do this sqrt operation because the area of a circle is A=πr², which means that the random point distribution is proportional to r², so the uniform rectilinear random generator is transformed to be a uniform circular one.

Next, we generate a random angle `theta` between 0 and 2π, which represents the angle of the polar coordinate inside the circle. 

With the random radius `r` and angle `theta`, we can use trigonometry to calculate the x and y offsets from the circle's center: `r * cos(theta)` for the x-coordinate and `r * sin(theta)` for the y-coordinate.

Finally, we add the circle's x_center and y_center to the x and y offsets to get the absolute x and y coordinate of the random point within the circle.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as \[7, 0\] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.

    The algorithm is to use a Depth-First Search on the grid, only updating the cost when it finds a lower-cost path. The search starts at (0, 0) and follows the directions in the grid while prioritizing modifying the signs as little as possible.

The cost of each cell in the grid is initially set to a large value. A queue is used to iteratively apply the DFS procedure. A cell is checked if it is within the boundaries of the grid and if the distance to it is less than the currently stored cost, then update the cost of the cell and push the cell coordinates onto the queue.

For each dequeued cell, iterate over all four directions, calculate the new cell coordinates according to the direction, check if the grid value matches the current direction (+1 because 1-indexed). If it does not match, increase the cost by 1. Call the DFS procedure with the new cell's row, column, and the cost.

Once the DFS procedure has been applied to all cells, the minimum cost of reaching the bottom-right cell is stored in `cost[m - 1][n - 1]`.

    In this dynamic programming algorithm, we start by iterating over every element in the matrix (except the first row). For each element (i, j), we find the minimum value from the row above (i.e., i-1), considering the left [i-1][j-1], top [i-1][j], and right [i-1][j+1] positions (if they exist). We add the minimum value to the current element, iteratively updating the sum of each falling path as we go down the matrix. Once we reach the last row, we find the minimum element in this row, which represents the minimum sum of any falling path.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), as it iterates over the n x n matrix once.

Else, if either the left or the right subtree returns a non-null value, the function returns that value, signaling up the recursion chain that a target node has been found.

    The algorithm initializes a sliding window of size `k`. The sliding window is used as a data structure that keeps track of the current `k` elements and maintains the ordering of the values, which can be a multiset or sorted list.

Loop through the array from position `k` until the end. For each iteration, calculate the median of the current sliding window. If `k` is even, the median is the mean of the two middle values; if `k` is odd, the median is the middle value. Push the median value into a result array.

Remove the leftmost element of the sliding window (the one that is out of the window now), and insert the next element in the array into the sliding window. Continue this process until the end of the array, and return the result array containing the median values. 

This algorithm takes advantage of the ordered data structure to achieve an efficient median retrieval for each sliding window.

3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.

open question,"A **self-dividing number** is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

*   For example, `128` is **a self-dividing number** because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

A **self-dividing number** is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return _a list of all the **self-dividing numbers** in the range_ `[left, right]`.

    The algorithm consists of two functions: `isSelfDividing` and `selfDividingNumbers`. The first function, `isSelfDividing`, takes an integer as input and returns true if it is a self-dividing number and false otherwise. It does this by checking each digit of the number and verifying that they're nonzero and that the number is divisible by that digit. The checking is done by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and finding the remainder.

The second function, `selfDividingNumbers`, takes `left` and `right` as input, and returns a list of self-dividing numbers in the given range. It iterates through all the numbers between `left` and `right` (inclusive) and checks if the number is a self-dividing number using the `isSelfDividing` function. If it is, the number is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.

*   `VideoSharingPlatform()` Initializes the object.
*   `int upload(String video)` The user uploads a `video`. Return the `videoId` associated with the video.
*   `void remove(int videoId)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, remove the video.
*   `String watch(int videoId, int startMinute, int endMinute)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, increase the number of views on the video by `1` and return the substring of the video string starting at `startMinute` and ending at `min(endMinute, video.length - 1``)` (**inclusive**).

    The solution works as follows:
1. Initialize the `size` of each number at `1` (single-digit numbers), the `length` of numbers of that size at 9 (there are 9 single-digit numbers), and the `start` number of size `1` as `1`.
2. Keep subtracting the total length of numbers of the current size from `n` as long as `n` is greater than the total length of numbers of that size.
3. Increment `size` and multiply `length` and `start` by `10` when moving to the next size.
4. Add `(n - 1) / size` to `start` (adjusted for index 0) to find the number in the sequence that contains the nth digit.
5. Convert the found number to a string, and return the digit at position `(n - 1) % size`. In C++ and JavaScript, subtract '0' or use `parseInt` to convert the character back to an integer.

**Explanation:** The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part (colored in red) shows the path with the maximum price sum. The second part (colored in blue) shows the path with the minimum price sum.

    The problem requires us to find the maximum possible cost among all possible root choices after calculating the price sum of all paths. To achieve this, we will follow the steps below:

1. Create an adjacency list to store the tree structure based on the given edges.
2. Define a variable `dp` to store the maximum and minimum price sum in the format `dp[u] = [[maxF, maxS], [minF, minS]]`, where `u` is the current node.
3. Perform a Depth-First Search traversal starting from node 0.
  - During the traversal, for each node `u`, calculate the maximum and minimum price sums by traversing all of its children nodes.
4. After the traversal, calculate the maximum possible cost among all possible root choices by iterating through the `dp` array and taking the difference between each node's maximum and minimum price sums.
5. Return the maximum possible cost.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes. The reason lies in the fact that we store our data in an adjacency list, which speeds up the DFS traversal.

    The algorithm uses Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We initialize a 2D array `dp` with 6 rows (corresponding to the numbers on the die) and n + 1 columns. We fill the first column of the `dp` array with all 1s since there's only one way for each number to occur once. We also initialize an array `sum` to store the cumulative sum.

We iterate through the rolls (2 to n) and for each number on the die (0 to 5), we update the `dp[i][j]` value. The general idea is that the total unique sequences ending in each die number i after j rolls is the sum of all sequences after j - 1 rolls minus the sequences that would violate the `rollMax[i]` constraint. We update the running sum for each roll and keep track of it in `sum`.

After traversing all rolls, the `sum[n]` will contain the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exactly n rolls, which we return as the output.

open question,"Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `ith` folder in the file system.

*   For example, `[ ""one "", ""two "", ""three ""]` represents the path `""/one/two/three ""`.

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.

*   For example, folders `""/a ""` and `""/b ""` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should **all** be marked:
    *   `/a`
    *   `/a/x`
    *   `/a/x/y`
    *   `/a/z`
    *   `/b`
    *   `/b/x`
    *   `/b/x/y`
    *   `/b/z`
*   However, if the file structure also included the path `""/b/w ""`, then the folders `""/a ""` and `""/b ""` would not be identical. Note that `""/a/x ""` and `""/b/x ""` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return _the 2D array_ `ans` _containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in **any** order_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** paths = \[\[ ""a ""\],\[ ""c ""\],\[ ""d ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b ""\],\[ ""c "", ""b ""\],\[ ""d "", ""a ""\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ ""d ""\],\[ ""d "", ""a ""\]\]
**Explanation:** The file structure is as shown.
Folders  ""/a "" and  ""/c "" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named  ""b "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** paths = \[\[ ""a ""\],\[ ""c ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b ""\],\[ ""c "", ""b ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b "", ""x ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b "", ""x "", ""y ""\],\[ ""w ""\],\[ ""w "", ""y ""\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ ""c ""\],\[ ""c "", ""b ""\],\[ ""a ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b ""\]\]
**Explanation:** The file structure is as shown. 
Folders  ""/a/b/x "" and  ""/w "" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named  ""y "".
Note that folders  ""/a "" and  ""/c "" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** paths = \[\[ ""a "", ""b ""\],\[ ""c "", ""d ""\],\[ ""c ""\],\[ ""a ""\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ ""c ""\],\[ ""c "", ""d ""\],\[ ""a ""\],\[ ""a "", ""b ""\]\]

1.  If the number of the elements in the stream is less than `m` you should consider the **MKAverage** to be `-1`. Otherwise, copy the last `m` elements of the stream to a separate container.
2.  Remove the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the container.
3.  Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements **rounded down to the nearest integer**.

Implement the `MKAverage` class:

*   `MKAverage(int m, int k)` Initializes the **MKAverage** object with an empty stream and the two integers `m` and `k`.
*   `void addElement(int num)` Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.
*   `int calculateMKAverage()` Calculates and returns the **MKAverage** for the current stream **rounded down to the nearest integer**.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MKAverage "",  ""addElement "",  ""addElement "",  ""calculateMKAverage "",  ""addElement "",  ""calculateMKAverage "",  ""addElement "",  ""addElement "",  ""addElement "",  ""calculateMKAverage ""\]
\[\[3, 1\], \[3\], \[1\], \[\], \[10\], \[\], \[5\], \[5\], \[5\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, -1, null, 3, null, null, null, 5\]

**Explanation**
`MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1);  obj.addElement(3);        // current elements are [3] obj.addElement(1);        // current elements are [3,1] obj.calculateMKAverage(); // return -1, because m = 3 and only 2 elements exist. obj.addElement(10);       // current elements are [3,1,10] obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [3,1,10].                           // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be [3].                           // The average of [3] equals 3/1 = 3, return 3 obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5] obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5] obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5,5] obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [5,5,5].                           // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be [5].                           // The average of [5] equals 5/1 = 5, return 5`

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= m <= 105`
*   `1 <= k*2 < m`
*   `1 <= num <= 105`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `addElement` and `calculateMKAverage`.","

def minimum_working_time(jobs, k):
    max_job = max(jobs)
    sum_jobs = sum(jobs)
    
    left, right = max_job, sum_jobs
    while left < right:

            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
```

    
    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the minimum possible maximum working time. We initialize left to be the maximum job time and right to be the sum of all job times. Our goal is to find the smallest possible value such that there can be `k` or fewer partitions of jobs, where the sum of each partition's jobs' times is less than or equal to that value.

We start by finding the middle value between left and right. We then iterate through the jobs and keep track of the current sum and the number of current partitions (`count`). If adding the job exceeds the mid value, we increase the partition count and reset the current sum to 0.

After iterating through all jobs, if our partitions count is less than or equal to k, we set right to be the mid value. Otherwise, we set left to be mid + 1. We continue narrowing the binary search space until left >= right.

At the end, left is the minimum possible maximum working time for any assignment, and we return it.

open question,"There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. The root of the tree is the node labeled `0`.

Each node has an associated **value**. You are given an array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` node.

Select any two **non-overlapping** subtrees. Your **score** is the bitwise XOR of the sum of the values within those subtrees.

Return _the_ _**maximum**_ _possible **score** you can achieve_. _If it is impossible to find two nonoverlapping subtrees_, return `0`.

**Note** that:

*   The **subtree** of a node is the tree consisting of that node and all of its descendants.
*   Two subtrees are **non-overlapping** if they do not share **any common** node.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[1,3\],\[1,4\],\[2,5\]\], values = \[2,8,3,6,2,5\]
**Output:** 24
**Explanation:** Node 1's subtree has sum of values 16, while node 2's subtree has sum of values 8, so choosing these nodes will yield a score of 16 XOR 8 = 24. It can be proved that is the maximum possible score we can obtain.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\]\], values = \[4,6,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no possible way to select two non-overlapping subtrees, so we just return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `values.length == n`
*   `1 <= values[i] <= 109`

    first_max[0] = max(first_max[0], current_sum)

    return current_sum
```
    
    We first convert the given edges into an adjacency list representation of the tree. In the main `maxXorSubtree` function, we initialize the `firstMax` variable that will store the maximum XOR value of a subtree rooted in any node.

Then we perform a depth-first traversal of the tree, starting at the root. In the traversal (`dfs` function), we keep track of the current node, its parent, the tree, the values array, and a reference to the `firstMax` variable.

For each node in the tree, we calculate the sum of values in its subtree (the currentSum). To do this, we first set the currentSum to the value of the node itself. Then, we iterate over its children and recursively call the `dfs` function on them. During this process, we XOR the currentSum and the sum of values in each child's subtree. After visiting all children, we update the `firstMax` variable with the maximum XOR value we've encountered so far.

Finally, we return the XOR of the root's value and the `firstMax` value. Since the subtrees are non-overlapping and don't include the root, this is the maximum possible score we can achieve.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,100,200,1,100\], key = 1
**Output:** 100
**Explanation:** For target = 100, there are 2 occurrences at indices 1 and 4 which follow an occurrence of key.
No other integers follow an occurrence of key, so we return 100.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1, n]. We create a helper function called `backtrack` that recursively generates combinations. In this helper function, we have a base case where if the size of the current combination is equal to k, we add it to the result. Otherwise, we iterate through the numbers from the start index to n, add the current number to the current combination, and make a recursive call with an incremented start index. After the call, we ""undo"" the decision by removing the number from the current combination (backtracking).

The main function initializes an empty result list, calls the `backtrack` function with a start index of 1 and an empty current combination list, and then returns the result list.

Using these four values, we can compute the maximum subarray sum of the concatenated array through several cases. If k is 1, the maximum subarray sum is just the maximum sum of the single array. If k > 1, we can either take the maximum subarray sum of the array multiplied by k, or combine the maximum prefix sum, maximum suffix sum, and the sum of the array multiplied by k minus 2 to find the maximum subarray sum.

*   The value of each substring is less than or equal to `k`.

Return _the **minimum** number of substrings in a **good** partition of_ `s`. If no **good** partition of `s` exists, return `-1`.

**Note** that:

*   The **value** of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of `""123 ""` is `123` and the value of `""1 ""` is `1`.
*   A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""165462 "", k = 60
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** We can partition the string into substrings  ""16 "",  ""54 "",  ""6 "", and  ""2 "". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""238182 "", k = 5
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no good partition for this string.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is a digit from `'1'` to `'9'`.
*   `1 <= k <= 109`

    The algorithm goes through the input string `s` from left to right. We maintain a `currentValue` variable that will store the value of the substring we're currently generating. We also maintain an index `idx` variable to track the current position in the string `s`. 

We loop through the string `s` with a while loop. In the inner while loop, we accumulate digits into `currentValue` until the combined value becomes larger than `k`. Once we reach the limit, we increment the `count` variable to represent a new partition and reset `currentValue`. If at any point we have `currentValue` as 0, it means that even a single digit is larger than `k`, so we return -1.

Our algorithm continues in this manner, partitioning the string into substrings until we reach the end of the string `s`. The `count` variable keeps track of the minimum number of partitions in a good partition.

open question,"Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

            candidate = num
        count += (num == candidate) - (num != candidate)

    return candidate
```
    
    The algorithm used here is called the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm. It works by initializing a candidate element and a count. Then, we iterate through the given array. If the count is 0, we set the candidate to the current element in the array. Then we update the count by adding 1 if the current element is equal to the candidate, or subtracting 1 otherwise. At the end of the iteration, the candidate will have the majority element.

The algorithm works because if there is a majority element, it will always appear more than the sum of all other elements, so the count will not be 0 at the end.

open question,"You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

*   If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward**, and
*   If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

Since the array is **circular**, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

*   Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
*   Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
*   `k > 1`

Return `true` _if there is a **cycle** in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Input:** nums = \[2,-1,1,2,2\]

**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.

    The algorithm is designed to detect a cycle in a circular array. It uses a slow and fast pointer approach inspired by the ""Floyd's Tortoise and Hare"" algorithm. The slow pointer moves one step at a time and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the array, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet at the same index.

The algorithm iterates through the entire array to detect any possible cycle with the given starting index. For each index, the slow and fast pointers are initialized, and the getNextIndex function is used to get the next index, considering the circular nature of the array. The loop continues to execute as long as the slow and fast pointers are different and the product of nums[slow] and nums[fast] is positive.

If the slow and fast pointers meet, there is a possibility of having a cycle. To verify this, the algorithm checks if there is a cycle by traversing from the start index, and if there is no cycle, it returns true. If no cycle is found, the algorithm continues to search the array for cycles.

Finally, if there is no cycle in the whole array, it returns false.

*   For each cell `matrix[row][col]` (`0 <= col <= n - 1`) where `matrix[row][col] == 1`, `col` is present in `s` or,
*   **No cell** in `row` has a value of `1`.

You need to choose `numSelect` columns such that the number of rows that are covered is **maximized**.

Return _the **maximum** number of rows that can be **covered** by a set of_ `numSelect` _columns._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,0,1\]\], numSelect = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix\[2\]\[1\] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix\[2\]\[2\] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.

**Example 2:**

    The MajorityChecker class utilizes an unordered_map (in C++) / HashMap (in Java) / defaultdict (in Python) / Map (in JS) to store the positions of each element in the array. When initializing the class, the positions map is built accordingly. When querying the majority element, we use the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm with randomization:

1. Select a random index within the range of the subarray.
2. Check if the selected element occurs threshold times or more in the whole array (using the size of the stored positions).
3. If it occurs threshold times or more, check if it occurs threshold times or more in the subarray (using the lower_bound and upper_bound functions).
4. If it occurs threshold times or more within the subarray, return the element as majority.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for 20 iterations. If no majority element is found, return -1 as no majority found.

The lower_bound and upper_bound functions help to find the first index at which the target is greater than or equal to the existing element and the first index which is greater than the target, respectively.

The algorithm works effectively as the majority element occurs more than half of the times, so the probability of picking it randomly in the 20 iterations is very high.

    1. First, we need to find the prefix sum of each row in the matrix. This means that the value at the cell (i, j) will store the sum of all elements from (i, 0) to (i, j) in the same row.
2. Then, we iterate through all possible column pairs (col1, col2), and calculate the sum between those columns for each row using the prefix sum.
3. We use a hashmap to store the sum we have encountered so far and their counts.
4. For each row, update the sum and check how many times we have encountered the sum - target from the hashmap.
5. Add the count and update the hashmap for the current sum.
6. Return the total count after iterating all possible column pairs.

open question,"A word's **generalized abbreviation** can be constructed by taking any number of **non-overlapping** and **non-adjacent** substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths.

*   For example, `""abcde ""` can be abbreviated into:
    *   `""a3e ""` ( `""bcd ""` turned into `""3 ""`)
    *   `""1bcd1 ""` ( `""a ""` and `""e ""` both turned into `""1 ""`)
    *   `""5 ""` ( `""abcde ""` turned into `""5 ""`)
    *   `""abcde ""` (no substrings replaced)
*   However, these abbreviations are **invalid**:
    *   `""23 ""` ( `""ab ""` turned into `""2 ""` and `""cde ""` turned into `""3 ""`) is invalid as the substrings chosen are adjacent.
    *   `""22de ""` ( `""ab ""` turned into `""2 ""` and `""bc ""` turned into `""2 ""`) is invalid as the substring chosen overlap.

Given a string `word`, return _a list of all the possible **generalized abbreviations** of_ `word`. Return the answer in **any order**.

                res.append(word[:i] + '1' + item)

```
    
    The algorithm to generate generalized abbreviations works as follows:
1. If the input word is empty, return an empty abbreviation.
2. Initialize an empty result list.
3. Iterate over the length of the word, performing the following steps:
   a. Recursively generate abbreviations for subsequences.
   b. Check if it's the first iteration or if the item is not a number.
      If true, append the word slice and item to the result list.
   c. Check if the item is a number.
      If true, append the word slice and item with '1' between them to the result list.
4. Return the result list containing all possible generalized abbreviations.

This method ensures non-overlapping and non-adjacent substrings because, at each recursive call, we add only one digit or a character. Hence, there will always be either a digit or a character between two digit substrings. Since we do not combine multiple adjacent characters into a single multi-digit substring, we comply with the constraints mentioned in the problem statement.

1. If the root does not exist, return 0.
2. If both the left and right children of the root do not exist, then it is a leaf node. Append 0 to the depths list and return 1.
3. Create left and right lists for storing depths from left and right subtrees respectively.
4. Calculate count by recursively calling the dfs() function for left and right subtrees.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[4,1,2\], nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** \[-1,3,-1\]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

    The algorithm uses a stack, following these steps:

3. For every element in nums1, get the next greater element found in step 2 or -1 if no such element was found.

The key point is using the stack to keep track of the previous elements that still need to find their next greater element while iterating nums2 in a single pass. This ensures that the algorithm runs in linear O(n) time complexity.

You can apply the following operation on the string **any** number of times:

*   Choose any substring of size `k` from `s` and **flip** all its characters, that is, turn all `1`'s into `0`'s, and all `0`'s into `1`'s.

Return _the number of **distinct** strings you can obtain_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Note** that:

*   A binary string is a string that consists **only** of the characters `0` and `1`.
*   A substring is a contiguous part of a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""1001 "", k = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** We can obtain the following strings:
- Applying no operation on the string gives s =  ""1001 "".
- Applying one operation on the substring starting at index 0 gives s =  ""**011**1 "".
- Applying one operation on the substring starting at index 1 gives s =  ""1**110** "".
- Applying one operation on both the substrings starting at indices 0 and 1 gives s =  ""**0000** "".

This helps to build the strobogrammatic numbers by appending to the center of the existing numbers until the desired length is reached. Inside the loop, the code adds the possible pairs of strobogrammatic digits (""1"" + s + ""1"", ""6"" + s + ""9"", ""8"" + s + ""8"", ""9"" + s + ""6"") and for even lengths only, it adds 0s as well (""0"" + s + ""0""). This is because when we are building the number from the center, we cannot have leading zeros. Finally, it returns the list of strobogrammatic numbers of length n.

open question,"You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose **one** of the following options:

*   If `word1` is non-empty, append the **first** character in `word1` to `merge` and delete it from `word1`.
    *   For example, if `word1 = ""abc ""` and `merge = ""dv ""`, then after choosing this operation, `word1 = ""bc ""` and `merge = ""dva ""`.
*   If `word2` is non-empty, append the **first** character in `word2` to `merge` and delete it from `word2`.
    *   For example, if `word2 = ""abc ""` and `merge = "" ""`, then after choosing this operation, `word2 = ""bc ""` and `merge = ""a ""`.

Return _the lexicographically **largest**_ `merge` _you can construct_.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `""abcd ""` is lexicographically larger than `""abcc ""` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 =  ""cabaa "", word2 =  ""bcaaa ""
**Output:**  ""cbcabaaaaa ""
**Explanation:** One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge =  ""c "", word1 =  ""abaa "", word2 =  ""bcaaa ""
- Take from word2: merge =  ""cb "", word1 =  ""abaa "", word2 =  ""caaa ""
- Take from word2: merge =  ""cbc "", word1 =  ""abaa "", word2 =  ""aaa ""
- Take from word1: merge =  ""cbca "", word1 =  ""baa "", word2 =  ""aaa ""
- Take from word1: merge =  ""cbcab "", word1 =  ""aa "", word2 =  ""aaa ""
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 =  ""abcabc "", word2 =  ""abdcaba ""
**Output:**  ""abdcabcabcaba ""

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`
*   `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.","
    ```python
def largest_merge(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    merge = []
    while word1 or word2:
        if word1 > word2:
            merge.append(word1[0])
            word1 = word1[1:]
        else:
            merge.append(word2[0])
            word2 = word2[1:]
    return ''.join(merge)
```
    
    The algorithm iterates through both `word1` and `word2` until they are both empty. At each step, it compares the two strings and appends the first character of the lexicographically larger string to the `result` string. It then removes that character from its respective string (using `erase` in C++, `substring` in Java, slicing in Python, and `slice` in JavaScript). Once both `word1` and `word2` are empty, the loop ends, and the constructed `result` string is returned.

This algorithm ensures that we prioritize the lexicographically larger character when appending to the result, always creating the largest possible merged string.

open question,"Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,1,2,1,2\]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
*   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.","
    ```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
```
    
    The algorithm utilizes the XOR bitwise operation. XOR is a binary operation that outputs 1 when the inputs differ and 0 when the inputs are the same. 

To find the single element that appears once in the array, we XOR all elements in the array. Since every pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out as `a ^ a = 0`, the remaining XOR result would be the single unique number, as `0 ^ a = a`.

The algorithm processes the array once, giving it a linear time complexity of O(n), and only requires a constant amount of extra space to store the `result` variable, satisfying the requirements.

open question,"Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]

    We use two pointers `i` and `j`. `i` starts at the first element and `j` at the second. We go through the array with `j` and compare the elements at the two pointers. If they are different, it means we found a unique element, so we move `i` to the next position and copy the value from `j` to `i`. When we finish going through the array, the length of the unique part is `i+1`.

open question,"Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See following example)._

For example, you may encode the following `3-ary` tree to a binary tree in this way:

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6\]

Note that the above is just an example which _might or might not_ work. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6\]

    To encode the given N-ary tree into a binary tree recursively, we perform the following steps:

1. For each node of the N-ary tree, create a corresponding binary tree node with the same value.
2. Store the first child of the N-ary tree node as the left child of the binary tree node.
3. Iterate through the remaining children in the N-ary tree node, placing each child to the right of the first child of the binary tree node. In other words, we represent the siblings of the N-ary tree as the right children in the binary tree.
4. We repeat this process until every node in the given N-ary tree has been processed.

For decoding the binary tree back to N-ary tree, we reverse the process followed for encoding. While traversing the binary tree, we create a new N-ary tree node with the same value, retrieve its children from the left child and its subsequent right children of the binary tree node.

Note, in both cases, we recursively perform the process for every node in the original tree.

The above algorithms are shown in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

open question,"An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  ""112358 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  ""199100199 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

The graph is given as a 2D array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the original graph, and `cnti` is the total number of new nodes that you will **subdivide** the edge into. Note that `cnti == 0` means you will not subdivide the edge.

In this **new graph**, you want to know how many nodes are **reachable** from the node `0`, where a node is **reachable** if the distance is `maxMoves` or less.

    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the peak index in the mountain array. It starts with two pointers, `low` and `high`, initially set to the beginning and end of the array. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the middle index as `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` (in Python, use integer division). If the middle element is smaller than the next one, we know the peak is to the right, so we update `low` to `mid + 1`. If not, the peak is to the left, and we update `high` to `mid`. The loop continues until `low` and `high` pointers meet, where the peak index is found and returned.

    The algorithm initializes an empty result string (or StringBuilder in Java for better performance). We iterate through the input string and for each character, we use a `while` loop to check if the current index `i` is in the `spaces` array (by comparing `i` to `spaces[j]` where `j` is initialized at 0). If we need to add a space before the current character, we append a space to the result string and increment `j`. The current character at index `i` of the input string is then appended to the result string. The final result string is returned after iterating through the input string. The algorithm's time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, as each character in the input string is visited once.

Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

For each internal node with operator `o`, the [**infix expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.

The tree below is also a valid binary expression tree with the same inorder traversal as s, but it not a valid answer because it does not evaluate to the same value.

    This solution follows the algorithm of the well-known Shunting Yard algorithm. We process the input string `s` character by character. 

1. If the character `s[i]` is a digit, create a `TreeNode` with the value and push it to the `nodes` stack.
2. If the character is an opening parenthesis, push it to the `ops` stack.
3. If the character is a closing parenthesis, pop the operators from the `ops` stack and process them with the corresponding `TreeNode` operands until an opening parenthesis is found. Then, pop the opening parenthesis.
4. If the character is an operator (+, -, *, or /), pop the operators from the `ops` stack and process them with the corresponding operands until there is a lower precedence operator on the top or the stack is empty. Finally, push the current operator onto the `ops` stack.

After processing all characters in the input string `s`, process the remaining operators left in the `ops` stack.

The Shunting Yard algorithm guarantees that the resulting expression tree will have the correct precedence and associativity rules applied.

We update the current sum by multiplying it with 10 and adding the value of the current root to it. If the current node is a leaf node (both left and right are null), we return the current sum.

Finally, the result is a sum of the values returned from the left and right subtrees. Since we use the same code for all languages, the only difference lies in the syntax and how the null values are handled.

        if s[j] >= g[i]:

    return i
```

    
    The algorithm first sorts both the greed factors of children `g` and the sizes of cookies `s`. Next, two pointers are declared, `i` for the greed factors and `j` for the cookies. 
The algorithm then iterates through the sorted lists in parallel using a while loop until either the greed factors or the cookies run out. Inside the loop, we check if the current cookie `s[j]` is greater than or equal to the current greed factor `g[i]`. If it is, that means the child is content and we increment the `i` pointer to the next child. In both cases (whether the child is content or not), we move on to the next cookie by incrementing the `j` pointer.
The algorithm returns the number of content children (`i`) once the loop is done.

open question,"We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

*   For example, `""abc ""` can be shifted to be `""bcd ""`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

*   For example, we can keep shifting `""abc ""` to form the sequence: `""abc "" -> ""bcd "" -> ... -> ""xyz ""`.

Given an array of strings `strings`, group all `strings[i]` that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strings = \[""abc"",""bcd"",""acef"",""xyz"",""az"",""ba"",""a"",""z""\]
**Output:** \[\[""acef""\],\[""a"",""z""\],\[""abc"",""bcd"",""xyz""\],\[""az"",""ba""\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strings = \[""a""\]
**Output:** \[\[""a""\]\]

def groupStrings(strings):
    groups = defaultdict(list)

        key = tuple((ord(c) - ord(s[0])) % 26 for c in s)
        groups[key].append(s)

    return list(groups.values())
```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

At the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the price of the `ith` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.

**Note:** The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

Return _the **maximum** number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with_ `coins` _coins._

You must solve the problem by counting sort.

**Input:** costs = \[1,3,2,4,1\], coins = 7
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit after completing `i` transactions up to day `j`. Initialize `dp` with all zeros, since no initial transactions will result in 0 profit.

First, handle the case where `k > n / 2`. If allowed transactions (`k`) are more than half of the available days (`n`), you can simply trade daily by only considering positive profits.

Now, use two nested loops to fill the `dp` table. The outer loop iterates over the allowed transactions (1 to k), and the inner loop iterates over the days (1 to n-1). Inside the inner loop, find the maximum difference between the current day's price and previous days' prices minus the maximum profit after completing one less transaction at previous days (i.e., `prices[j] + dp[i-1][j'] - prices[j']` for all j' < j). This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

Finally, return the value in the bottom-right corner of the `dp` table (i.e., `dp[k][n-1]`), which provides the maximum profit after completing the allowed number of transactions.

The reason behind sorting attack values in ascending order and defense values in descending order is to process characters with higher attack values first.

    The algorithm is based on using two deques or double-ended queues, `first` and `second`. At any given point, the middle element(s) of the queue can be found between the last element of `first` and the first element of `second`. 

When a new element is pushed to the front, middle, or back, depending on the size relationship between the two deques, adjustments are made by transferring elements between `first` and `second`.

For operations that involve popping elements, we check if the queue is empty or not. If it is empty, we return -1. If not, we remove the appropriate element based on the size relationship between the two deques and adjust the deques accordingly, similar to the push operations.

    maxLen = [0]

```

    
    This problem can be solved by using a depth-first search approach. We first need to traverse the tree and compare the values of each node with its children. We start at the root node and, for each node, we determine if the current node has the same value as its left and right children. If it does, we calculate the univalue path for the current node by calculating the length of the path from the left subtree and the length of the path from the right subtree.

We recursively traverse the tree to find the longest univalue path, and we keep track of the maximum length found so far. When visiting a node, we call the function recursively on its left and right children. If the current node's value is the same as the left or right child, we increase the path length by 1. Otherwise, we reset the path length to 0.

The final result is the maximum univalue path found during the traversal of the tree.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

    The base algorithm is depth-first search (DFS). The idea is to loop through the entire grid and for each cell with a value of '1', increment the island count by 1 and run the DFS algorithm starting on this cell. During the DFS traversal, we modify the grid by setting the visited cells containing '1' to '0', which will avoid visiting the same land cell again. The DFS traversal stops when the boundaries of the grid are reached or a '0' cell is hit. The DFS runs recursively on the neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) of the current cell.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n) since we may have to visit every cell in the worst case, where m and n are the row and column dimensions of the grid.

open question,"You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains **one less block** than the row beneath it and is centered on top.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific **triangular patterns** that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a **single block** stacked on top of **two blocks**. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings `allowed`, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.

*   For example, `""ABC ""` represents a triangular pattern with a `'C'` block stacked on top of an `'A'` (left) and `'B'` (right) block. Note that this is different from `""BAC ""` where `'B'` is on the left bottom and `'A'` is on the right bottom.

You start with a bottom row of blocks `bottom`, given as a single string, that you **must** use as the base of the pyramid.

Given `bottom` and `allowed`, return `true` _if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that **every triangular pattern** in the pyramid is in_ `allowed`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bottom =  ""BCD "", allowed = \[ ""BCC "", ""CDE "", ""CEA "", ""FFF ""\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.
Starting from the bottom (level 3), we can build  ""CE "" on level 2 and then build  ""A "" on level 1.
There are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are  ""BCC "",  ""CDE "", and  ""CEA "". All are allowed.

    We first create a mapping from two-character keys to the list of possible top characters for a triangle. Then, we use a recursive helper function to build the pyramid. If the bottom row's length reaches 1, it means the pyramid is complete and we return true. If the index reaches the bottom length minus 1, we have just completed one level of the pyramid and need to continue for the next level. At each step, we try different allowed triangles and continue the recursion. If any allowed character leads to a successful pyramid, we return true. If there is no possible combination left, we return false.

open question,"A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:

*   `coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term `**9**x4` is `9`.
*   `power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term `9x**4**` is `4`.
*   `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:

The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in **strictly** descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return _the head of the sum of the polynomials_.

**`PolyNode` format:**

The input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.

2. If the input string starts with '[', it means the NestedInteger is a list. Initialize the stack, curr, and start variables.
3. Iterate through the string, one character at a time. 
    a. If the current character is '[', push the current NestedInteger object onto the stack (if it exists), and create a new NestedInteger object.
    b. If the current character is ',' or ']', add the NestedInteger object formed by the sub-string between the start and the current index (if the sub-string is not empty) to the curr NestedInteger object. Update the start index to the next character.
    c. If the current character is ']' and the stack is not empty, pop the topmost NestedInteger from the stack, add the curr NestedInteger to it, and update the curr NestedInteger to the popped NestedInteger.
4. Once the iteration is complete, the curr NestedInteger contains the deserialized NestedInteger. Return it.

This algorithm works for all languages by converting the string into language-specific data structures (e.g., stringstream in C++ and istringstream in Python). The rest of the implementation remains the same across all languages.

open question,"You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of length `n`. Each string consists **only** of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'` where:

*   The characters `'L'` and `'R'` represent pieces, where a piece `'L'` can move to the **left** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its left, and a piece `'R'` can move to the **right** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its right.
*   The character `'_'` represents a blank space that can be occupied by **any** of the `'L'` or `'R'` pieces.

Return `true` _if it is possible to obtain the string_ `target` _by moving the pieces of the string_ `start` _**any** number of times_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** start =  ""\_L\_\_R\_\_R\_ "", target =  ""L\_\_\_\_\_\_RR ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to  ""**L**\_\_\_R\_\_R\_ "".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to  ""L\_\_\_R\_\_\_**R** "".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to  ""L\_\_\_\_\_\_**R**R "".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** start =  ""R\_L\_ "", target =  ""\_\_LR ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain  ""\_**R**L\_ "".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** start =  ""\_R "", target =  ""R\_ ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == start.length == target.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `start` and `target` consist of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`.","

    The solution checks if it is possible to move the pieces in the `start` string to form the `target` string. We can iterate through both strings with two pointers `p` and `q`.

1. Move the pointers `p` and `q` in `start` and `target` until a character 'L' or 'R' is encountered.
2. If both `p` and `q` hit the end of their strings, break the loop.
3. If the characters at pointer `p` and `q` are different, return false as it could never form the target string.
4. Check for illegal movements of 'L' and 'R':
   - If there is a 'L' at pointer `p` in `start` and pointer `p` is less than pointer `q`, it means 'L' should move to the right, which is an illegal movement, return false.
   - If there is a 'R' at pointer `p` in `start` and pointer `p` is greater than pointer `q`, it means 'R' should move to the left, which is an illegal movement, return false.
5. Move pointers `p` and `q` to the next character.
6. After breaking the loop, if both pointers reach the end of their respective strings, then it is possible to form `target` from `start`. Return true, otherwise return false.

    We can solve this problem by using Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph of cities:

1. Create a boolean array `visited` of size n (the number of cities) initialized with `false` values.
2. Initialize a counter variable `provinces` to count the number of provinces and set it to 0.
3. Iterate through each city from 0 to n-1.
   - If the city has not been visited, call a DFS helper function to traverse the connected components.
   - Increment the `provinces` counter for every new group of connected cities.
4. In the DFS helper function, mark the given city `i` as visited.
5. Iterate through all other cities from 0 to n-1.
   - If the cities `i` and `j` are directly connected (isConnected[i][j] == 1) and city `j` has not been visited, call the DFS helper function with city `j`.
6. Return the total number of provinces.

This algorithm ensures that all directly and indirectly connected cities are visited, and their connected components are counted as provinces. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) as in the worst case, we might have to visit all possible edge connections between cities.

    The algorithm first reverses the entire array, then reverses the first `k` elements, and finally reverses the remaining `n-k` elements where `n` is the length of the array. The reversing operation is done in-place so as not to use extra memory.

This is achieved using a `reverse` function that swaps elements at positions `start` and `end` and increment `start` and decrement `end` until `start` is greater than or equal to `end`. The `reverse` function basically reverses the elements between the given positions.

    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The main idea is to store the number of valid permutations at each position, for increasing and decreasing subsequences, based on the character in the input string. The DP array consists of n + 2 elements.

Iterate through the input string s. If the current character is 'I', that means the current element should be smaller than the next element. So, the count of valid permutations ending at position i should be added to the count of valid permutation for position (i + 1).

On the other hand, if the character is 'D', that means the current element should be greater than the next element. So, the count of valid permutations ending at position i should be added to the count of valid permutation for position i.

We use a new DP array in each iteration, which is then replaced with the original DP array. Repeating these steps, we can find the total number of valid permutations at the end. The result will be stored in the first element of the DP array: `dp[0]`.

2. If the key is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree, so set root's left child be the result of the deleteNode function, where root's left child is the root.
3. If the key is larger, it lies in the right subtree, so set root's right child be the result of the deleteNode function, where root's right child is the root.
4. If the key is equal to the root's key, this is the node to be deleted.
   - If the node with the key has no left child, return its right child.
   - If the node with the key has no right child, return its left child.
   - If the node has both children, find the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree), replace the node's value with the value of the inorder successor, and then delete the inorder successor.

Remove every node which has a node with a **strictly greater** value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[5,2,13,3,8\]
**Output:** \[13,8\]
**Explanation:** The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,1,1,1\]
**Output:** \[1,1,1,1\]
**Explanation:** Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`","

    We first check if the head of the linked list is `null` or not, if it is `null`, then we return `null`. Now, we create the pointer variables `maxNode`, `currentNode`, and `prevNode`. We initialize `maxNode` and `currentNode` to point to head and `prevNode` as `null`.

We use the `while` loop to traverse the linked list. Inside the loop, we check if the value of the next node is strictly greater than the value of `maxNode`. If it is, we update the pointer of the previous node to point to the next node, and update the value of `maxNode`. If not, we set `prevNode` as the `currentNode`.

At the end of the loop, we call `removeNodes` recursively on the next node of `maxNode` and update the next pointer of `maxNode` to the result of that call. Finally, we return the modified `head`.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

*   A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

**Example 1:**

In one second, you can either: - Move vertically by one unit, - Move horizontally by one unit, or - Move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in one second).

        dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[i-1][1])
        time += max(dx, dy)

    The algorithm calculates the minimum time to visit all the points by iterating through the given points, and for each pair of consecutive points, finding the difference in their x and y coordinates (dx and dy). Since moving diagonally is the fastest way to cover a unit of distance vertically and horizontally, the time needed to move between two points is the maximum of dx and dy.

In each language, the code follows the same logic: iterate through the points, calculate the difference in x and y coordinates, and add the maximum of those differences to the total time. The primary differences are in syntax and the specific functions used to calculate the absolute value and maximum value.

open question,"In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **""Road to Freedom ""** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **""Freedom Trail Ring ""** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return _the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword_.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `""12:00 ""` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `""12:00 ""` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1.  You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `""12:00 ""` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2.  If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `""12:00 ""` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ring =  ""godding "", key =  ""gd ""
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring  ""godding "" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become  ""ddinggo "".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ring =  ""godding "", key =  ""godding ""
**Output:** 13

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
*   `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
*   It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.","

                    step = min(diff, n - diff)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], step + dp[i + 1][k])

    return dp[0][0] + m
```

    
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming. Create a 2D table (""dp"") with the dimensions of the length of the key + 1 as rows and the length of the ring as columns. The table represents the minimum number of steps required to reach each character in the key by aligning it to the 12:00 direction.

The main logic runs in reverse of the key string. For each character in the key, the outer ring positions are iterated and checked if the character in the ring matches the character in the key. The minimum steps to reach the matching character are calculated and updated in the ""dp"" table.

Finally, the first element in the ""dp"" table would represent the minimum number of steps required to complete the whole key. The result is the sum of that value and the length of the key.

open question,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise **one** of the two rights:

*   **Ban one senator's right:** A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
*   **Announce the victory:** If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string `senate` representing each senator's party belonging. The character `'R'` and `'D'` represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be `""Radiant ""` or `""Dire ""`.

    The algorithm uses a power of choices using round-based voting which works as follows:

1. Create two queues: Radiant and Dire, and a variable `n` to store the length of the senate string.
2. Iterate through the `senate` string, and for each character, enqueue the position to the respective queue.
3. While both queues are not empty, dequeue an element from each queue (Radiant and Dire). Compare if the radiant element is smaller; then enqueue radiant element + `n` to the Radiant queue, otherwise, enqueue dire element + `n` to Dire queue.
4. When one of the queues is empty, return the victory of the party that still has elements in the queue. If the Radiant queue is not empty, return ""Radiant"", otherwise, return ""Dire"".

This way, the algorithm simulates the round-based voting, considering the best strategy for each party. When one party is no longer able to vote, the other party wins.

The main algorithm follows these steps:
1. Loop through all bases `b` between 2 and `n - 2`.
2. For each base `b`, convert the integer `n` to its string representation using the `to_base_str` function.
3. Check if the resulting string is palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
4. If any string from step 3 is not palindrome, return `false`.
5. If all strings from step 3 are palindrome, return `true` after completing the loop.

In a run-length encoded array of even length `encoding` (**0-indexed**), for all even `i`, `encoding[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `encoding[i + 1]` is repeated in the sequence.

*   For example, the sequence `arr = [8,8,8,5,5]` can be encoded to be `encoding = [3,8,2,5]`. `encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5]` and `encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5]` are also valid **RLE** of `arr`.

Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.

Implement the `RLEIterator` class:

*   `RLEIterator(int[] encoded)` Initializes the object with the encoded array `encoded`.

1. Convert the integer 'n' to a string for easier manipulation.
2. Sort the digits of 'n' in ascending order.
3. Try every possible permutation of the digits by using the next_permutation function (or equivalent) until you find a permutation that satisfies the requirements (the leading digit is not zero and the resulting number is a power of two).
4. It then checks if the current permutation is a power of two using bitwise operations to count the number of set bits. If there's exactly one '1' bit, then it's a power of two.
5. If the algorithm finds a valid permutation, it returns true, otherwise it returns false when all permutations have been checked.

open question,"You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

*   `'A'`: Absent.

*   `'P'`: Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:

*   The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
*   The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

Return `true` _if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

    The algorithm first calculates the prefix sum of the array. Then, it initializes a double-ended queue (deque) to store indices of the prefix sum. For each index of the calculated prefix sum, perform these steps:

1. Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, update the result with the minimum value. This means we found a subarray that meets the requirement of sum >= k, so we remove the deque's front element to see if there's a shorter subarray.
2. In an increasing order within the deque, check if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at the back of deque. If true, remove the last element. The goal here is to maintain each element of the deque in increasing order.
3. Add the index to the deque.

Finally, after iterating through all elements, check if the stored result is valid. If valid, return the result; otherwise, return -1. This logic is implemented in all 4 language solutions.

For Java, we use the `contains` method of the `String` class to check if the pattern is present.

For Python, we use the `in` operator to check if the pattern is present in the word.

For JavaScript, we use the `includes` method of the `String` class to check if the pattern is present.

    We will iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the prefix sum which stores the sum of elements from the start to the current index in the `prefix` array. We will use a monotonic stack to maintain the indices of the elements in a strictly decreasing order. For each element, we will keep popping elements from the stack as long as the top element is greater than the current element. This ensures that we always have the minimum element at the top of the stack, which will be used to calculate the min-product. After popping each element, we update the result using the element at the popped index multiplied by the sum of elements between the current and the index before the top of the stack. This ensures that we get the maximum min-product of any non-empty contiguous subarray. Finally, return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

You can buy apples in **any** city you want, but some cities have different costs to buy apples. You are given the array `appleCost` where `appleCost[i]` is the cost of buying one apple from city `i`.

You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually buy **exactly** one apple from **any** city. After you buy that apple, you have to return back to the city you **started** at, but now the cost of all the roads will be **multiplied** by a given factor `k`.

- Starting at city 4: You take the path 4 -> 3 -> 2 then you buy at city 2, and finally take the path 2 -> 3 -> 4. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 42 + 1 \* 2 + 2 \* 2 = 51.

    The problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm. It is important to always choose the road with the lowest cost possible to buy apples or back to the original city. The approach is to create a graph and use a priority queue that is sorted from the lowest to the highest cost in each step. 

1. Create the graph from the input roads.
2. Loop through each city as a starting point.
3. For each start city, initialize a priority queue and the distance array.
4. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, calculate the costs for buying apples in each city from the current start city and the costs back to the start city after buying apples. Note that the cost of the roads back to the start city will be the road cost multiplied by k.
5. Store the calculated cost in the answer array for each start city.
6. Return the answer array.

open question,"Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered **almost equivalent** if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is **at most** `3`.

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `true` _if_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _are **almost equivalent**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 =  ""aaaa "", word2 =  ""bccb ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are 4 'a's in  ""aaaa "" but 0 'a's in  ""bccb "".
The difference is 4, which is more than the allowed 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 =  ""abcdeef "", word2 =  ""abaaacc ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 1 time in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'b' appears 1 time in word1 and 1 time in word2. The difference is 0.
- 'c' appears 1 time in word1 and 2 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'd' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'e' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'f' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 =  ""cccddabba "", word2 =  ""babababab ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 2 times in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'b' appears 2 times in word1 and 5 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'c' appears 3 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 3.

open question,"Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return _the **next greater number** for every element in_ `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1\]

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

    The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the elements in the `nums` array. We traverse the array twice (using modulo operator) since it's circular. For each element, we check if it's greater than the top element (index) of the stack. If it is, we update the corresponding result for that index with the current element and pop the index from the stack. We push the current index onto the stack if we are still in the first traversal.

Finally, we return `result` list which holds the next greater element for all elements in the input list. If a greater element is not found for an element, its value in the result list will remain `-1`.

    The algorithm utilizes a Hashtable, in which we store the integer value present in the array as the key and its latest index position as the value.

If it is, we also check if the difference between the current index and the latest index stored in the Hashtable is less than or equal to k. If both conditions are met, we return `true` because there are two repeating integers having an index difference less than or equal to k. Otherwise, we add the number along with its latest index to the Hashtable and continue with the next element. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

Note: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(min(n, k)).

The circular double-ended queue (deque) is implemented with an array (or vector in C++), two pointers, 'front' and 'rear', and an integer 'size', which represents the current number of elements in the deque. The array has a fixed capacity, 'k'. Front represents the index of the first element in the deque, and rear points to the index after the last element in the deque.

Insertion or deletion is done by manipulating these pointers, front and rear accordingly. When the deque is full, the front and rear pointers wrap around, creating a circular structure.

The main operations are:

1. insertFront(): inserts an element at the front of the deque. To do this, the front pointer is first decremented and then the value is inserted.
2. insertLast(): inserts an element at the rear of the deque. The value is directly inserted at the rear and the rear pointer is incremented.
3. deleteFront(): deletes an element from the front of the deque by incrementing the front pointer.
4. deleteLast(): deletes an element from the rear of the deque by decrementing the rear pointer.
5. getFront(): returns the front element of the deque.
6. getRear(): returns the rear element of the deque.
7. isEmpty(): returns true if the deque is empty.
8. isFull(): returns true if the deque is full.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

open question,"Design the basic function of **Excel** and implement the function of the sum formula.

Implement the `Excel` class:

*   `Excel(int height, char width)` Initializes the object with the `height` and the `width` of the sheet. The sheet is an integer matrix `mat` of size `height x width` with the row index in the range `[1, height]` and the column index in the range `['A', width]`. All the values should be **zero** initially.
*   `void set(int row, char column, int val)` Changes the value at `mat[row][column]` to be `val`.
*   `int get(int row, char column)` Returns the value at `mat[row][column]`.
*   `int sum(int row, char column, List numbers)` Sets the value at `mat[row][column]` to be the sum of cells represented by `numbers` and returns the value at `mat[row][column]`. This sum formula **should exist** until this cell is overlapped by another value or another sum formula. `numbers[i]` could be on the format:
    *   `""ColRow ""` that represents a single cell.
        *   For example, `""F7 ""` represents the cell `mat[7]['F']`.
    *   `""ColRow1:ColRow2 ""` that represents a range of cells. The range will always be a rectangle where `""ColRow1 ""` represent the position of the top-left cell, and `""ColRow2 ""` represents the position of the bottom-right cell.
        *   For example, `""B3:F7 ""` represents the cells `mat[i][j]` for `3 <= i <= 7` and `'B' <= j <= 'F'`.

**Note:** You could assume that there will not be any circular sum reference.

    The algorithm for this problem involves using a 2D array (matrix) to represent the values in the Excel sheet and a hashmap (formulas) to store sum formulas for cells in the Excel sheet. When using the 'set' method, the cell value in the matrix is set to the input value and any existing sum formula for the cell is removed. When using the 'get' method, the method first checks if a sum formula exists for the cell in focus. If it does, it returns the result of the sum formula without updating the matrix; otherwise, it returns the value in the matrix for the cell. When using the 'sum' method, the algorithm iterates through the input 'numbers', summing up the corresponding cell values based on the range given by either a single cell reference or a range of cells. The sum total is then set as the cell value in the matrix and the formula is stored in the 'formulas' hashmap. The sum total is returned as the result.

open question,"A shop is selling candies at a discount. For **every two** candies sold, the shop gives a **third** candy for **free**.

The customer can choose **any** candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the **minimum** cost of the two candies bought.

*   For example, if there are `4` candies with costs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the customer buys candies with costs `2` and `3`, they can take the candy with cost `1` for free, but not the candy with cost `4`.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` denotes the cost of the `ith` candy, return _the **minimum cost** of buying **all** the candies_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the **only** way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[6,5,7,9,2,2\]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[5,5\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.

We say that an integer x is **expressible** from `nums` if there exist some integers `0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length` for which `nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x`. In other words, an integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR of some subsequence of `nums`.

    The algorithm first sorts the input array. Then, it initializes a ""result"" variable with a value of 1, which represents the smallest positive non-zero integer.

The algorithm then iterates through the sorted array. For each number, it checks whether the current number is greater than the ""result"" variable. If it is, the algorithm breaks out of the loop, because it has found the smallest positive number that cannot be expressed as the bitwise OR of a subsequence of the input array.

If the current number is not greater than the ""result"" variable, the algorithm updates the ""result"" variable by adding the current number to it. This is because the sorted array guarantees that the numbers are in increasing order, so the bitwise OR of any subsequence of the array will always produce a result greater than or equal to the current ""result"" variable.

Finally, the algorithm returns the value of the ""result"" variable, which represents the smallest positive non-zero integer that cannot be expressed as the bitwise OR of a subsequence of the input array.

If the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the next player can always make the other player take the last stone.

If the number of stones is not divisible by 4, the player can make the next player play with a number of stones divisible by 4, thus making the next player lose.

    The algorithm consists of two functions, `findKthPalindrome` and `palindrome_queries`.

`findKthPalindrome` function receives two parameters – k and intLength. The function calculates the middle part's (`mid`) length of the palindrome number using half of the given `intLength`. Next, calculates the limit of the iteration by raising 10 to the power of mid and subtracting 1 from the result. 

The function iterates from 0 to this calculated limit. For each number in the iteration, a possible palindrome number is generated by concatenating the reverse of the string representation of the number. If the desired intLength has an odd length, exclude the first digit from the reversed part. 

The generated palindrome number is checked to be greater than zero. If it's a positive palindrome, decrement k. When k reaches 0, the generated number is the k-th palindrome of the given length, and return the palindrome number. If k never reaches 0 in the iteration, return -1.

`palindrome_queries` function takes two parameters: a list/array of queries and intLength. The function maps `findKthPalindrome` function on each element of the queries array/list, so every ith element in the returned list/array has the queries[i]th smallest positive palindrome of length intLength or -1 if no such palindrome exists.

We iterate through the dp matrix, and if nums1[i-1] is equal to nums2[j-1], we get a new connecting line, and the value will be dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. If the numbers are not equal, we pick the maximum value from the left or the upper cell (dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]) because either we pick a number from nums1 or nums2 but not both.

    The algorithm works by iterating through the array in reverse order. It keeps track of the maximum element found so far as it iterates through the array. In each iteration, the current element in the array is replaced with the maximum element found so far (initially set as -1, following the problem statement). The iteration then continues to the next element in reverse order and keeps updating the maximum element found. Finally, the modified array is returned.

open question,"Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = \[1,2,3\], capital = \[0,1,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `order` of length `n`, a **permutation** of integers from `1` to `n` representing the **order** of insertion into a **binary search tree**.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

*   All subsequent elements are inserted as the **child** of **any** existing node such that the binary search tree properties hold.

Return _the **depth** of the binary search tree_.

A binary tree's **depth** is the number of **nodes** along the **longest path** from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

    Starting from the last car to the first, we calculate the time it takes for each car to collide with the car ahead. We only consider collisions if the current car is moving slower than the car ahead (cars[j][1] > cars[i][1]). For each collision, we calculate the collision time as the distance between the cars divided by the speed difference (current_collision = (cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (cars[i][1] - cars[j][1])). We then update the minimum collision time if the current collision time is smaller, and also ensure we store the smallest between the minimum collision time and any collision times that are already recorded for the car ahead. The collision time for each car is updated in an array, with the value `-1` when a car does not collide with the car ahead. Finally, the function returns the array of collision times.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `""ace ""` is a subsequence of `""abcde ""`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

    We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `text1.length + 1` and `text2.length + 1`. The indices `(i, j)` of the array will store the length of the longest common subsequence of the substrings `text1` and `text2` until index `i` and `j` respectively.

We loop through the two strings and compare their characters at positions `i - 1` and `j - 1` (since indices are 0-based). If the characters are the same, the value of `dp[i][j]` will be equal to the `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` + 1; otherwise, we set `dp[i][j]` equal to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.

After iterating through both strings, the result will be stored at `dp[m][n]` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`.

    The algorithm keeps track of three counts: 'same', 'less', and 'greater'. These counts store the number of characters that are the same, less, and greater in string a compared to string b, respectively. Iterate through the characters in a and b simultaneously, comparing each character and updating the counts accordingly. The minimum number of operations needed to satisfy one of the three conditions is then calculated as the minimum of the sum of 'same' and the maximum of 'less' and 'greater', as well as 'less' and 'greater' individually. This is because you can either change all 'same' characters and one of 'less' or 'greater', or change only one of 'less' or 'greater' while keeping the other characters in the same order.

2. Create a temporary variable `temp` equal to the given `num`.

    The algorithm uses binary search to find the median in less than O(m * n) time complexity. We start by defining the search bounds with `low` and `high`. Then, we perform a binary search by selecting a `mid` value between `low` and `high`. For each `mid`, we count the elements that are less than or equal to `mid` using the `upper_bound` or `countElements` functions depending on the language.

We then compare the count with the target count - which is `(m * n) / 2 + 1`, as the matrix is guaranteed to have an odd number of elements. If the count is less than the target count, it means that our current `mid` value is too small, so we update `low` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, our `mid` value is a candidate for the median, so we update `high` to `mid`. 

We continue the iteration until the `low` pointer is equal to the `high` pointer, at which point we have found the median of the matrix, and we return the `low` pointer value.

The algorithm is as follows:

    The given problem is to rotate the matrix layers counter-clockwise by k times. First, we need to find the number of layers in the matrix, which is the minimum of the number of rows (m) and the number of columns (n) divided by 2. Then, for each layer, we calculate the number of elements in it, as (m - 2 * layer) * 2 + (n - 2 * layer - 2) * 2, and also calculate the effective number of rotations required to be done, effective_k = k % numToRotate.

Next, we loop through the layers and perform a counter-clockwise rotation for each layer. To do this, we swap the elements in the current layer in the following order:

1. From top-left to bottom-left
2. From bottom-left to bottom-right
3. From bottom-right to top-right
4. From top-right to top-left

We perform the above steps effective_k times for each layer. Finally, we return the rotated grid.

3. We loop as long as min heap size is equal to the number of lists. Within the loop:
   a. We get the smallest value and its list index from the min heap.

    The algorithm uses the concept of prefix-sum to answer range-sum queries efficiently. In the constructor, we iterate through the input `nums` array and build an additional `pSum` array, which stores the prefix sum for each position i, i.e., sum of all elements from index 0 to index i (inclusive) of `nums`.

The `sumRange` method is simply a matter of taking the difference between two elements in the prefix-sum array. This difference will be the sum of elements between the given `left` and `right` indices (inclusive) in the input array.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) for `sumRange` queries after the O(n) pre-processing of the input array during the constructor call. The space complexity is O(n) for the `pSum` array.

    The algorithm first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input array `nums`. Then it calculates the ideal bucket size by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the length of the array minus one. The algorithm then initializes an array of buckets, where each bucket contains the minimum and maximum values of its elements.

Next, the algorithm updates the minimum and maximum values for each bucket appropriately by iterating through the input array. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum gap by finding the difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket, and updating the maximum gap value accordingly.

This algorithm runs in linear time, because it iterates through the input array once to fill the buckets, and then it iterates through the buckets once to compute the maximum gap. It also uses linear extra space, as the number of buckets is proportional to the length of the input array.

open question,"You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

*   **`""Push ""`**: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
*   **`""Pop ""`**: removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following rules:

*   If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
*   If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
*   If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.

Return _the stack operations needed to build_ `target` following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.

Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1,2\].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = \[1\].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1,3\].

**Input:** target = \[1,2,3\], n = 3
**Output:** \[ ""Push "", ""Push "", ""Push ""\]
**Explanation:** Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1\].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1,2\].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1,2,3\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = \[1,2\], n = 4

Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1\].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = \[1,2\].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.

It then appends another ""Push "" to the `result` array for the current number in `target`, as we want to keep it in the stack.

Finally, it increments the current number in the stream and moves on to the next number in `target`. The resulting `result` array will have the operations needed to build the stack.

*   **Lock:** **Locks** the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
*   **Unlock: Unlocks** the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
*   **Upgrade****: Locks** the given node for the given user and **unlocks** all of its descendants **regardless** of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if **all** 3 conditions are true:
    *   The node is unlocked,
    *   It has at least one locked descendant (by **any** user), and
    *   It does not have any locked ancestors.

Implement the `LockingTree` class:

*   `LockingTree(int[] parent)` initializes the data structure with the parent array.
*   `lock(int num, int user)` returns `true` if it is possible for the user with id `user` to lock the node `num`, or `false` otherwise. If it is possible, the node `num` will become **locked** by the user with id `user`.
*   `unlock(int num, int user)` returns `true` if it is possible for the user with id `user` to unlock the node `num`, or `false` otherwise. If it is possible, the node `num` will become **unlocked**.
*   `upgrade(int num, int user)` returns `true` if it is possible for the user with id `user` to upgrade the node `num`, or `false` otherwise. If it is possible, the node `num` will be **upgraded**.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""LockingTree "",  ""lock "",  ""unlock "",  ""unlock "",  ""lock "",  ""upgrade "",  ""lock ""\]

**Output**
\[null, true, false, true, true, true, false\]

**Explanation**
LockingTree lockingTree = new LockingTree(\[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2\]);
lockingTree.lock(2, 2);    // return true because node 2 is unlocked.
                           // Node 2 will now be locked by user 2.
lockingTree.unlock(2, 3);  // return false because user 3 cannot unlock a node locked by user 2.
lockingTree.unlock(2, 2);  // return true because node 2 was previously locked by user 2.
                           // Node 2 will now be unlocked.
lockingTree.lock(4, 5);    // return true because node 4 is unlocked.
                           // Node 4 will now be locked by user 5.
lockingTree.upgrade(0, 1); // return true because node 0 is unlocked and has at least one locked descendant (node 4).
                           // Node 0 will now be locked by user 1 and node 4 will now be unlocked.

```
    
    The algorithm first calculates the number of possible subsets, which is `2^n`, where `n` is the length of the input array. Then, it iterates through all possible subsets by using an integer `i` as a bitmask. For each subset, we calculate the XOR total and accumulate it in the `result` variable.

For each integer `i` in the range `[0, numSubsets)`, we iterate through the bits (from 0 to `n-1`). If the `j`-th bit of `i` is set (equal to 1), that means the `j`-th element is included in the current subset. We use the bitwise XOR (`^`) operator to calculate the XOR total for this subset. Finally, we add the XOR total to the result.

After iterating through all subsets, the algorithm returns the final `result`, which is the sum of all XOR totals of every subset of `nums`.

open question,"Given a string s, return _the number of **distinct non-empty subsequences** of_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `""ace ""` is a subsequence of `""abcde ""` while `""aec ""` is not.

```
    
    The algorithm uses a sliding window approach where two pointers ""left"" and ""right"" traverse through the `fruits` array while maintaining a frequency ""count"" hashmap (or map in JavaScript) to count the occurrences of different fruits in the current window.

1. First, initialize `left`, `right`, and `max_count` to 0, and an empty hashmap for `count`.
2. Perform a while loop where the condition is `right < length of fruits`.
3. Update the hashmap `count` with the fruit at the right index, incrementing the count by 1.
4. If the hashmap size is greater than 2, it means more than two types of fruits are in the current window, so we need to remove the leftmost fruit from the hashmap and increment the left pointer.
5. Calculate the maximum collected fruit count (`max_count`) by getting the max of the current `max_count` and the number of fruits in the current window (i.e., `right - left + 1`).
6. Increment the right pointer to move the window.
7. When the while loop finishes, return the `max_count`.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `stations` of length `n`, where `stations[i]` represents the number of power stations in the `ith` city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed **range**. In other words, if the range is denoted by `r`, then a power station at city `i` can provide power to all cities `j` such that `|i - j| <= r` and `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`.

*   Note that `|x|` denotes **absolute** value. For example, `|7 - 5| = 2` and `|3 - 10| = 7`.

The **power** of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building `k` more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers `r` and `k`, return _the **maximum possible minimum power** of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally._

**Note** that you can build the `k` power stations in multiple cities.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stations = \[1,2,4,5,0\], r = 1, k = 2
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become \[1,4,4,5,0\].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stations = \[4,4,4,4\], r = 0, k = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 
It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.

*   `n == stations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= stations[i] <= 105`
*   `0 <= r <= n - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 109`","

    min_power = float('inf')

        min_power += k
        min_power = min(min_power, total_power[j])

    return min_power
```
    
    Initially, we calculate the `totalPower` for all cities by iterating through all stations and adding their power to the cities in their range. Then, initialize two variables: `sumk` to store the sum of the middle stations between `r` to `n - r` (exclusive), and `minPower` to store the maximum possible minimum power of a city.

We loop through the cities from `1` to `n - 2 * r`, incrementing the iterator `j`. During each iteration, we subtract the power from the city `i + r + 1`, add the power from the city `j`, and add the value of `k` to the `minPower`. Then we update the `minPower` to be the minimum between the current `minPower` and the `totalPower` of the city `j`. Finally, return the value of `minPower`.

Splitting of an integer array `nums` into **subarrays** is **valid** if:

*   each element of `nums` belongs to exactly one subarray.

Return _the **minimum** number of subarrays in a **valid** subarray splitting of_ `nums`. If a valid subarray splitting is not possible, return `-1`.

**Note** that:

*   The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
*   A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,6,3,4,3\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can create a valid split in the following way: \[2,6\] | \[3,4,3\].
- The starting element of the 1st subarray is 2 and the ending is 6. Their greatest common divisor is 2, which is greater than 1.
- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.
It can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.

    The algorithm starts traversing the tree in a depth first search (DFS) from the root till each of the leafs. For each consecutive increasing path, it increments the length by one. If a node value breaks the consecutive sequence, it resets the length of that subtree. It keeps track of the maximum length of the consecutive path found so far in any of the subtrees, and updates it when it finds a longer path. Finally, it returns that value.

```
    
    The algorithm uses a while loop and a dictionary (lookup) to check if the given string is strobogrammatic. The main idea is to iterate through the string with two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer starts at the beginning of the string and `right` starts at the end.

For each step of the while loop:
1. Check if the character at the `left` pointer is in the `lookup` dictionary, if not, return false.
2. Check if the mapped (rotated) character of the character at the `left` pointer matches the character at the `right` pointer, if not, return false.
3. Increment `left` pointer and decrement `right` pointer.

If the loop finishes iterating through the string without returning false, then return true as the string is strobogrammatic.

open question,"Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[2,1,3\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.","

    The algorithm utilizes a pre-order traversal to serialize the binary search tree. When the tree is serialized, the val of each TreeNode is visited before its children. Empty nodes are represented by ""#"" and commas are used to separate values in the serialized string.

To deserialize, the function processes the serialized string and reconstructs the tree using the pre-order traversal pattern. When an empty node is encountered (indicated by ""#""), it returns null. Otherwise, it constructs a TreeNode for the current value, recursively deserializes the left and right children, and returns the constructed node.

    To find the number of equivalent domino pairs, we can use a hash map to count the frequencies of distinct dominoes. We loop through the given domino list and create a unique key for each domino by taking the minimum of the two numbers as the first part, and the maximum as the second part (this ensures that equivalent rotated dominoes have the same key).

For each domino, we increment the frequency count in the hash map and then add the current frequency count to the result. This sum represents the count of equivalent pairs found so far.

Once the loop is completed, we return the result as the total number of equivalent domino pairs.

*   The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two **adjacent** letters in `t` is less than or equal to `k`.

Return _the length of the **longest** ideal string_.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Note** that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of `'a'` and `'z'` is `25`, not `1`.

    The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the indexes of open parentheses. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty or not. If it's not empty, it pops the index of the open parenthesis. If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching open parenthesis and marks the close parenthesis for removal with either an empty string (for Python and JavaScript) or a '-' character (for C++ and Java). 

After iterating over the entire string, the algorithm marks any leftover open parentheses for removal by iterating over the stack. In the end, the unnecessary '-' characters or empty strings are removed or replaced to create the valid string, which is then returned.

If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset**, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return _the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.

In the end, add one more `duration` to the total to account for the last attack.

open question,"You are given a **0-indexed** 2D array `grid` of size `2 x n`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`. Each robot may only move to the **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).

At the start of the game, the **first** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells `(r, c)` traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to `0`. Then, the **second** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The **first** robot wants to **minimize** the number of points collected by the **second** robot. In contrast, the **second** robot wants to **maximize** the number of points it collects. If both robots play **optimally**, return _the **number of points** collected by the **second** robot._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[2,5,4\],\[1,5,1\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
The second robot will collect 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 points.

**Input:** grid = \[\[3,3,1\],\[8,5,2\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.

    The algorithm for solving this problem involves simply iterating through the given string and counting the number of adjacent equal characters. For every such pair, a type-2 operation can be performed to make them different, thus ensuring s becomes alternating.

1. Initialize a counter, `cnt`, to store the number of operations required.
2. Iterate through the characters of the string, starting from the second character (index 1), until the end of the string.
3. In every step, if the current character is equal to the previous character, increment the counter `cnt`. This indicates that a type-2 operation is needed to make them different.
4. Once the iteration is completed, return the value of `cnt`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

    We use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of steps required to make a string palindrome. The `dp[i][j]` element of the 2D `dp` array represents the minimum number of steps required to make a palindrome from substring `s[i..j]`. We iterate through the string in reverse order, and for each pair of characters, if the characters are equal, we update the `dp[i][j]` value using the `dp[i+1][j-1]`. If they are not equal, we update the `dp[i][j]` using the minimum value between `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`, adding 1 to it. In the end, we return the value at `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the minimum steps required to make the whole string palindrome.

One room divider has **already** been installed to the left of index `0`, and **another** to the right of index `n - 1`. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices `i - 1` and `i` (`1 <= i <= n - 1`), at most one divider can be installed.

Initially, `lower_bound` is set to the minimum possible value.

2. If the number is greater than the top of the stack, it means the number is the right child of the last node encountered. So, we pop from the stack and set the lower_bound to the last popped value until the stack is empty or the number is smaller than the top of the stack.
   
3. Push the number onto the stack.

The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true.

    The idea here is to generate the next possible larger palindrome by just manipulating the first half of the input string (since it's already a palindrome). We first extract the first half of the input string. For odd lengths, the middle character will be included in the first half as well.

Next, we generate the next permutation of the first half in lexicographically increasing order (hence it is guaranteed to be greater). If there's no such permutation, we return an empty string. For Python, we generate all possible permutations, convert them back to strings and return the smallest possible greater one. Note that it may not be the most efficient way for Python.

For the other half, we simply reverse the first half, and skip the middle character if the input length is odd.

Finally, we concatenate both halves and return the resulting string. If there's no next greater palindrome, the function returns an empty string.

    The solution is using depth-first search on the binary tree with a recursive function `longestConsecutiveSequence`. This function takes a node as input and returns the longest path of consecutive values that starts at that node. It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

```
    
    The algorithm uses bitwise operations to add the two integers without using + or - operators. The addition process can be divided into two parts: addition without considering a carry and handling the carry generated. 

1. XOR (^) can be used for adding without carrying, as it sets the bit at a position if the bits in the two numbers being added are different at that position.
2. AND (&) operation, followed by left shift (<<), is used to find the carry. With this operation, we find the bits which are set in both numbers, and they represent the carry. Then, we shift these bits to the left by one position, which is the correct position of the carry bit.

Finally, we keep looping until there is no carry, at which point we have the sum of the two integers. In the Python implementation, extra steps are required due to the lack of fixed-size integers.

open question,"Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step you can jump from index `i` to index:

*   `i + x` where: `i + x < arr.length` and `0 < x <= d`.
*   `i - x` where: `i - x >= 0` and `0 < x <= d`.

In addition, you can only jump from index `i` to index `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `arr[i] > arr[k]` for all indices `k` between `i` and `j` (More formally `min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)`).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return _the maximum number of indices_ you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12\], d = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.

```
    
    The algorithm uses one mutex for each fork and a condition variable for each philosopher to manage the synchronization of accessing forks. When a philosopher starts to eat, they first lock the mutex of the left fork and indicate that the corresponding fork is busy. After that, they try to lock the mutex of the right fork. If they are able to lock the right mutex, they can eat. After eating, they release the mutex of the right fork and indicate that it is not busy. Finally, the mutex of the left fork is unlocked.

To avoid deadlocks, a philosopher will only proceed with eating if they can lock the mutex of the right fork while holding the mutex of the left fork. If they can't lock the right mutex, they will wait using a condition variable until the right mutex is available. After eating, the philosopher will signal to other philosophers that they have finished eating and the forks are available.

The main idea of this approach is to ensure that a philosopher is always able to acquire both forks without causing deadlocks or starving. By waiting on the condition variable until both forks are available, we prevent deadlocks and ensure fairness among the philosophers. This behavior is obtained by having each philosopher try to grab its left fork first and then its right fork, only eating once it has acquired both. This ensures that philosophers will not deadlock by all grabbing one fork and waiting for another.

open question,"There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

*   `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
*   `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the **slowest** car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

    The algorithm works by first calculating the total sum of the array and finding the target sum we need to achieve by subtracting x from the total sum. If the target sum is less than 0, return -1 since it's not possible to reduce x to 0.

Next, initialize two pointers (left and right) to 0 and the sum variable to 0. Iterate through the array nums with the right pointer, updating the sum by adding the current element in the nums array.

Inside the loop, keep updating the left pointer by removing the leftmost element of the subarray and subtracting its value from the sum until the sum is less than or equal to target.

If the sum is equal to the target, update maxLength to the maximum value between maxLength and the difference between right and left pointers. 

Once the whole nums array has been processed, return -1 when maxLength remains -1 or the difference between the size of nums and maxLength as a result.

The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""iamprogrammer ""

**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined:  ""yo|uar|e\*\*|b|e\*\*\*au|tifu|l "". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars `'|'`, and asterisks `'*'`.
*   `s` contains an **even** number of vertical bars `'|'`.","

    The algorithm loops through the string with a simple for loop iterating on characters. It keeps track of the number of pipes encountered (pipeCount) and the total count of stars. If a pipe is encountered, increment pipeCount. If a star is encountered and pipeCount is even, increment the count. This condition (pipeCount % 2 == 0) ensures we are not considering stars between a pair of vertical bars. Finally, return the count of stars after processing the entire string.

    The algorithm works by performing a bitwise right shift on both the left and right edge of the range until both numbers become equal. This is done because the common bits to the left of the different bits are the bits that will survive the AND operation for all numbers in the range.

Since we right shifted x times, we perform a left shift x times on the equal numbers to restore the original position of the bits. As a result, we get the final bitwise AND of all the numbers in the range. This algorithm has a complexity of O(log N) due to the bitwise manipulation.

    We start by building the adjacency list representation of the graph using input connections. Then we perform a depth-first search to inspect and record the order in which each node was discovered (discovery time) and the lowest discovery time node that each node can reach through its adjacent nodes.

For each visited node that is not the parent node of the current node, we perform these steps:
1. If the visited node has not been discovered yet, we perform a DFS on that node and update the current node's lowest discovery time based on the visited node's lowest discovery time.
2. If the visited node's lowest discovery node is greater than the current node's discovery time, this visited node to current node connection is a critical connection as it indicates the visited node cannot be reached without this connection. We add this connection to the 'ans' result.
3. If the visited node has already been discovered, we update the current node's lowest discovery time based on the visited node's discovery time.

Once the DFS is completed, we return the list of critical connections 'ans'.

open question,"You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

*   For example, `strs = [ ""abc "", ""bce "", ""cae ""]` can be arranged as follows:

abc
bce
cae

You want to **delete** the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (**0-indexed**), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted, while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return _the number of columns that you will delete_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ ""cba "", ""daf "", ""ghi ""\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf
  ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ ""a "", ""b ""\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  a

    The algorithm first sorts the input array nums. If there is only 1 element or no element in the array, then the minimum difference becomes 0. Otherwise, the algorithm initializes the minimum difference as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Then, it iterates through the nums array and for each element, selects the highest and lowest values after applying the operation with k. Update the minimum difference as necessary by comparing the current high-low value difference with the minimum difference calculated so far. The algorithm does not modify the original nums array but rather focuses on updating the minimum difference variable. After finishing the iteration, the minimum difference is returned.

open question,"A game on an **undirected** graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they **must** travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it **must** travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in three ways:

*   If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
*   If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
*   If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return

*   `1` if the mouse wins the game,
*   `2` if the cat wins the game, or
*   `0` if the game is a draw.

    The algorithm initializes an m x n grid with all 0s and keeps track of the count of 0s (`_zero_count`). When the `pick()` function is called, it generates a random number between 0 and `zero_count - 1`. Then, it iterates over the grid elements, skipping the 1s. When it encounters a 0, it checks if the random index equals 0. If so, it flips the value to 1, decrements the zero count, and returns the current index. Otherwise, it decrements the random index value. This process ensures that each unfilled index has an equal chance of being picked.

The code is language-specific due to the random number generation mechanism and the classes/constructors used. However, the core algorithm remains the same across all languages. The time complexity is O(mn) as the function iterates through the entire grid. The space complexity is O(mn), as it stores the matrix. The usage of the built-in random function is minimized as it is called only once for each pick operation.

    The algorithm for solving this problem is as follows:

1. Create a graph representation of the n x n grid. The graph will have n * 3 rows and columns. The reason for this size is that we are going to divide the 1 x 1 grid cell with '/', '\', and ' ' into 9 smaller parts, making it easier to identify regions.

2. Loop through the grid and update the corresponding graph cells based on the '/' and '\' characters. For example, if we find '/' in grid[i][j], we update the graph at grid[i*3][j*3+2], grid[i*3+1][j*3+1], and grid[i*3+2][j*3] to 1.

3. Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) in the graph to count the number of regions.

4. Loop through the entire graph which represents the n x n grid. Whenever we find a cell with value 0, we increment the regions count and perform a DFS on that cell.

5. The DFS function will take graph, i, and j as input parameters. It will mark the cell as visited and call itself recursively for its neighboring cells.

6. The DFS function will stop when a cell is 1 or out of bounds.

7. Finally, we return the value of regions as the result. This will be the number of contiguous regions in the grid.

open question,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the **smallest** `divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,5,9\], threshold = 6
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).

    The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach. For each cell of the input matrix, we create a `dp` matrix that will store the size of the square that ends at the current cell `[i, j]`. If the current cell contains 1, we need to check the values of the neighbors, i.e., cells `[i-1, j-1]`, `[i-1, j]`, and `[i, j-1]`. To form a square of size `k`, all three neighboring cells must have squares of size `k-1`. Thus, we set the current cell in `dp` to the minimum of the neighboring cells plus one (`dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1`).

For each cell, we then add its value in the `dp` matrix to the result (`ans += dp[i][j]`). Finally, we return the total number of squares found.

    The algorithm starts by initializing an array `arr` of length `length` with all zeros. Then, it iterates over each update and simulates its effect on the array. For every update `[startIdx, endIdx, inc]`, the algorithm increases the value at index `startIdx` by `inc` and decreases the value at index `endIdx + 1` by `inc`, assuming `endIdx + 1` is within the bounds of the array. The reason behind this is that it will later make the algorithm simpler.

After processing all the updates, the actual values of the elements in the array are calculated using cumulative sums. The idea is that, for each element in the array after the first one, the final value is the previous value plus the current value. This will properly include the increments and decrements for each range from the updates.

Finally, the algorithm returns the updated array.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming combined with a deque to find the maximum score. The dynamic programming array (`dp`) is used to store the maximum score up to each index i. The deque maintains the indices of the largest potential scores from previous steps up to the current step within the k range.

For each index i, we first remove any elements that are out of the k range from the front of the deque. Then, the maximum score up to the index i is calculated as the sum of the score at the index stored at the front of the deque and the score at the current index.

Next, we remove any elements from the back of the deque that have a lower maximum score than the current score at index i. This helps in maintaining an ordered deque, ensuring that the best candidates are available when looking for a range to jump to. Finally, the index i is added to the back of the deque.

The maximum score is found in the last element of the dynamic programming array.

```
    
    The algorithm follows a simple approach to iterate through the string and count the homogenous substrings. It starts with `count = 1` representing the individual characters as valid homogenous substrings.

For each character in the string, we compare it with its previous character. If they match, we increment the `count`. If they don't match, we reset `count` back to one as these continuous substrings will start again with new characters.

As we iterate, we maintain a variable `total`, which contains the number of homogenous substrings found in the string. We sum this variable with `count` and update it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Finally, we need to account for the last character, so we sum `count` with `total` for the final answer.

Time complexity: O(n) as it iterates through the input string.
Space complexity: O(1) as it only maintains a few variables.
