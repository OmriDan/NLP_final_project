open question,"Design an algorithm that returns the number of colliding pairs (x,y) with h(x)=h(y) for a hash function h.",Use a counter array for each hash bucket. Count using n operations. Total time: O(n).,0.458642567,4.19921875
open question,What is the number of comparisons for inserting 6 elements into a binary max-heap? Give best and worst cases.,Best case: 5 comparisons. Worst case: 8 comparisons.,0.305995309,1.314453125
open question,"Union-Find with union by rank (no path compression). What is the depth of the final tree for n = 2^k? Ather that, Same Union-Find setup, but n = 2^k - 1. What is the maximal tree depth?","Depth is k. Only one tree with k levels remains. After that, k - 1. There will be one tree for each rank from 0 to k - 1.",0.166581293,3.119140625
Multiple Choice,"In AVL tree, after inserting a node, what can we say about the height of a node whose balance factor changed to 0?",B,0.183579743,5.21875
open question,"Analyze QuickSelect running time when pivot is √m-th element in each step, for fixed-rank selection.",T(n) = T(√n) + Θ(n) ⇒ T(n) = Θ(n),0.414985252,3.27734375
open question,"Given hash functions hi(x) = (x+i) mod m, is this family universal for m=13?",No. There’s guaranteed collision between 0 and 13 for all functions in the family.,0.371454156,3.560546875
